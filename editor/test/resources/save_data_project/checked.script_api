  members:
  - name: play_anim
    type: function
    desc: Plays the specified animation on a Spine model.
     A [ref:spine_animation_done] message is sent to the callback (or message handler).

     [icon:attention] The callback is not called (or message sent) if the animation is
     cancelled with [ref:spine.cancel]. The callback is called (or message sent) only for
     animations that play with the following playback modes
     * `go.PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD`
