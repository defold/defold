;; Clipping
;;
;; Clipping uses the stencil buffer. Similar to the depth buffer, the
;; stencil buffer is used to determine whether or not to draw by
;; comparing a value from the buffer with a value from what you're
;; drawing. For the depth buffer we're roughly comparing the z component
;; of what you're drawing with the value in the depth buffer. If the z
;; value is < (or > depending on axis direction?) we draw, and update the
;; depth buffer with the new z.
;;
;; For the stencil buffer the api is slightly different. The functions we
;; use are:
;;
;; * glStencilOp sfail dpfail dppass
;; * glStencilFunc func ref mask
;; * glStencilMask stencil-mask
;; * glEnable/glDisable with GL_STENCIL_TEST
;; * glClear with GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT
;;
;; When the stencil buffer is enabled, the following test is performed
;; before the depth test:
;;
;;     (ref & mask) func (<value from stencil buffer> & mask)
;;
;; If this test fails, we update the stencil buffer according to sfail.
;; If it succeeds and the depth test fails, we update according to dpfail.
;; If both tests pass, we update according to dppass and draw.
;;
;; The stencil buffer can be updated by incrementing or decrementing
;; the value, setting it to zero, inverting the bits, keeping the
;; original value or replacing it with ref. Only the bits masked by
;; stencil-mask are updated.
;;
;; The parameters we use are:
;;
;; * glStencilOp GL_KEEP GL_REPLACE GL_REPLACE
;;   The stencil buffer is updated whenever the stencil test
;;   succeeds. If the test fails, we keep the old value.
;;
;; * glStencilFunc GL_EQUAL ref mask
;;   With ref and mask set depending on where we are in the gui scene.
;;
;; * glStencilMask 0xff or 0
;;   Depending on if we're drawing a clipper or a normal node.
;;
;; So for us, the test is:
;;
;;     (ref & mask) == (<value from stencil buffer> & mask)
;;
;; And since we replace the value on success, the value written will
;; effectively be:
;; 
;;     (<old-stencil-value> & ~stencil-mask) | (ref & stencil-mask)
;;
;; But since we always set stencil-mask to 0xff or 0, we either leave
;; the bits as-is or replace it entirely.
;;
;; Note that ref is used both in the test and for setting the new
;; value.
;;
;; In Defold we assume the stencil buffer depth is 8 bits, so ref and
;; mask are 8 bits. We support inverted- and non-inverted clippers,
;; and clippers can be nested. Think of the clippers in a scene as
;; nested scopes. All nodes within a scope are drawn with a ref and
;; mask that identifies the scope in order to clip it properly. One
;; pseudo-scope covers the whole scene and any node drawn in that
;; scope (not under an actual clipper) is drawn without clipping
;; enabled. To identify nested non-inverted clipper scopes we split
;; the 8 bits of the ref value into groups. The value of each group is
;; roughly the steps in a path you take along the clipper hierarchy to
;; reach a particular non-inverted clipper scope. The nodes drawn
;; within that scope use as ref all the bits from the groups. The mask
;; is simply enough 1's to cover the group bits.
;;
;; In the example below, the clipper will be drawn using ref and mask set
;; accordingly, and any (non-clipper) child nodes with child ref and
;; child mask.
;;              clipper type     ref      mask     child ref  child mask
;; - scene
;;   - A        non-inverted     00000001 00000000 00000001   00000011
;;     - B      non-inverted     00000101 00000011 00000101   00001111
;;     - C      non-inverted     00001001 00000011 00001001   00001111
;;       - D    non-inverted     00011001 00001111 00011001   00011111

;;
;; In the scene scope, we have the non-inverted clippers A and H. Since
;; these are top level clippers we always want to draw them, so the mask
;; is 0. In order to draw their child nodes properly we need to be able
;; to distinguish the two scopes, so they each get assigned a unique ref
;; value within this scope: 01 and 10. We cannot use the value 0 when
;; identifying a scope, because that value is also used used "outside"
;; the clipper. So: 00 is off limits, 01 and 10 are taken. We have three
;; values and must use two bits for our first bit group. The child mask
;; is unsurprisingly 00000011.
;;
;; Looking below A we have the non-inverted clippers B, C and G. The refs
;; of each have 01 in the two lowest bits, and we use the mask 11 when
;; drawing to confine them to A. By the same reasoning as earlier we need
;; two more bits to distinguish their scopes.
;;
;; Looking at C, there is only one non-inverted clipper D in scope so
;; this time we only need one bit. Finally below D we need two bits.
;;
;; Effectively the ref bits are used as follows:
;;
;; Bits:     7          6 5      4   3 2         1 0
;; Meaning: [not used] [E or F] [D] [B, C or G] [A or H]
;;
;; If in this example there had been more non-inverted clippers under H,
;; the bit patterns in bit 7->2 could have been reused. There would be no
;; risk of confusing the scopes since bits 0 and 1 (A or H) would differ.
;;
;; Notice that the mask gets filled as we go deeper in the clipper
;; hierarchy.
;;
;; Inverted clippers doesn't fit the bit group scheme. We want to draw
;; the clipper using a ref that identifies the clipper. But when drawing
;; the nodes in its scope, we want to *not* draw where the inverted
;; clipper is drawn. We must also still respect the scopes of clippers
;; higher up in the hierarchy.
;;
;; It's like we want the stencil test for nodes in scope to check:
;; "We are drawing in the parent of the inverted clipper" AND
;; "We are not drawing in the inverted clipper"
;;
;; (inverted-clipper-parent-ref & inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask) ==
;; (<value from stencil-buffer> & inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask)
;; AND
;; inverted-clipper-bit-value != (<value from stencil buffer> & inverted-clipper-bit-mask)
;;
;; We can't do this literally with the stencil functions, but we can
;; express it differently:
;;
;; (inverted-clipper-parent-ref & inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask) ==
;; (<value from stencil-buffer> & inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask)
;; AND
;; 0 == (<value from stencil buffer> & inverted-clipper-bit-mask)
;;
;; Then we do the two comparisons simultaneously:
;;
;; ((0 | inverted-clipper-parent-ref) & (inverted-clipper-bit-mask | inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask)) ==
;; (<value from stencil-buffer> & (inverted-clipper-bit-mask | inverted-clipper-parent-child-mask))
;;
;; We allocate the non-inverted group bits from lowest to highest. Then
;; for each inverted clipper within a non-inverted clipper scope (or the
;; top level pseudo scope), we allocate and set 1 bit from highest ->
;; lowest. The nodes in scope of an inverted clipper then includes that
;; clippers bit in its mask, but uses a ref value with the bit set to 0 -
;; effectively the child ref value is unchanged.
;;
;; An example:
;;
;;              clipper type     ref      mask     child ref  child mask
;; - scene
;;   - A        non-inverted     00000001 00000000 00000001   00000011
;;     - B      non-inverted     00000101 00000011 00000101   00000111
;;   - C        non-inverted     00000010 00000000 00000010   00000011
;;     - D      inverted         10000010 00000011 00000010   10000011
;;       - E    inverted         01000010 10000011 00000010   11000011
;;     - F      inverted         00100010 00000011 00000010   00100011
;;       - G    non-inverted     00000110 00100011 00000110   00100111
;;         - H  inverted         00010110 00100111 00000110   00110111
;;   - I        inverted         10000000 00000000 00000000   10000000
;;     - J      non-inverted     00000011 10000000 00000011   10000011
;;
;; In the top level scene scope we have the obvious non-inverted clippers
;; A, C but now we also count J. The reason we include J in the scene
;; scope even though I lies between is that I is an inverted node. We
;; cannot use the bit we assign to I for distinguishing between A, C and
;; J. So, we have the off limits 00 + 01, 10, 11 for A, C and J requiring
;; 2 bits for the top level group.
;;
;; We assign bit 7 for I. We draw J with 0 in I's bit but with a mask
;; covering it. This makes sure we don't draw J on I. Notice that the
;; child mask of J must include I's bit.
;;
;; In the scope of C we have one non-inverted clipper G, requiring 1 bit,
;; and three inverted clippers D, E and F. Since we cannot use the bit
;; assigned to clippers to distinguish scopes, they get assigned one bit
;; each. We can not for instance use bit 6 for both E and F: when drawing
;; G we would be unable to draw where E was drawn.
;;
;; The implementation is mostly concerned with counting different types
;; of clippers in the scopes, assigning ref and mask values, and
;; transferring these to the scene nodes so the clipping is applied when
;; drawing.
;;
;; Visible Clippers
;;
;; Clippers can be marked as visible, meaning we draw them with the
;; color or texture assigned.
;;
;; We implement this by injecting a new scene node drawing the visible
;; part of the clipper. For inverted clippers, this representation must
;; still be drawn inside the clipper as opposed to the other children
;; being drawn only outside.
;;
;; Layers and rendering order
;;
;; For clipping to work properly, the clipper must be drawn before its
;; children. However, users can change the draw order of nodes (starting out
;; as depth first, in order traversal) by assigning layers to nodes. The clipper
;; nodes follow the same layer rules as regular gui nodes, so it is possible to
;; configure a draw order that does not appear to make sense. For example, one
;; could create a situation where the clipped nodes are drawn before the clipper
;; has written to the stencil buffer, effectively rendering the clipped nodes
;; invisible. Previously we had a much more complicated rule set for clipping,
;; layers and render order, but it ended up causing a lot of confusion and did
;; not really provide more flexibility, so we changed it back to using the same
;; rules as everything else.
;;
;; Bit overflow
;;
;; The 8 bits available creates some restrictions on how deep we can
;; nest clippers and how many clipper siblings we can have within the
;; scopes. If too many bits are needed the engine will start printing
;; warnings and clipping will simply break. In the editor we try to
;; recover from this by clearing the stencil buffer between rendering
;; each "top level" clipper in the scene. This helps if we have too
;; many siblings on the top level, but we can't recover from an
;; individual top level clipper tree requiring too many bits. It's
;; debatable whether we should even try to recover since the engine
;; can't.
