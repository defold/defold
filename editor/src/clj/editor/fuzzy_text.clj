;; Sublime Text-style fuzzy text matching.
;;
;; Based on the "Selecta" ranking algorithm by Gary Bernhardt:
;; https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta
;;
;; The original "Selecta" ranking algorithm is:
;; - Select each input string that contains all of the characters in the query.
;;   They must be in order, but don't have to be sequential. Case is ignored.
;; - The score is the length of the matching substring. Lower is better.
;; - If a character is on a word boundary, it only contributes 1 to the length,
;;   rather than the actual number of characters since the previous matching
;;   character. Querying "app/models" for "am" gives a score of 2, not 5.
;; - Bonus for exact queries: when several adjacent characters match
;;   sequentially, only the first two score. Querying "search_spec.rb" for
;;   "spec" gives a score of 2, not 4.
;; - Bonus for acronyms: when several sequential query characters exist on word
;;   boundaries, only the first two score. Querying the string
;;   "app/models/user.rb" for "amu" gives a score of 2, not 3.
;;
;; Some concrete examples of the original "Selecta" ranking algorithm:
;; - "ct" will match "cat" and "Crate", but not "tack".
;; - "le" will match "lend" and "ladder". "lend" will appear higher in the
;;   results because the matching substring is shorter ("le" vs. "ladde").
;;
;; Differences from the original "Selecta" ranking algorithm:
;; - A match of the first character in the string does not count towards the
;;   score. We do this to prioritize matches against the start of the string.
;; - Our algorithm treats camel humps similar to word boundaries so that they
;;   can be matched using acronyms.
;; - If the first matching character is not on a camel hump or a word boundary,
;;   our algorithm scores it by its distance from the previous word boundary.
;; - Our algorithm penalizes acronyms that skip over a camel hump or word
;;   boundary in the input string.
;;
;; Some concrete examples of the differences with our algorithm:
;; - "sp" will give "game/specs" a score of 2, but "aspect" a score of 3 since
;;   you pay for every unmatched character before a word boundary.
;; - "at" will give "abstract_tree" an ideal score, since the acronym matches
;;   every word boundary.
;; - "at" will give "abstract_syntax_tree" a lesser score than "abstract_tree",
;;   since the acronym missed the 's' on the middle word boundary.
