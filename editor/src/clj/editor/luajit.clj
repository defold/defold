;; We need to be consistent with the chunk names generated by the editor and bob
;; to ensure that the debugger works properly for both bundles apps and editor
;; builds. If the chunk names aren't consistent it will result in breakpoints
;; being skipped or files not being identified when hitting a breakpoint.

;; Bob sets the chunk name in LuaBuilder.constructBytecode():
;;
;; String chunkName = "@" + task.input(0).getPath()
;;
;; Resources in Bob are created in DefaultFileSystem.get() where the function
;; explicitly removes the initial / from the path.
;;
;; We replicate this chunk name format here by removing any initial /.
