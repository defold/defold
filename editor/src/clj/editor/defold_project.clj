(defn read-nodes
  "Reads and returns node-load-infos for a sequence of node-id+resource-pairs.
  If a .defunload file exists in the project, any resources that match one of
  the patterns therein will be skipped, and excluded from the list of returned
  node-load-infos. However, we may be forced to read and include them in the
  list if they are unsafely referenced from a loaded resource. Resource types
  can opt in to :allow-unloaded-use to declare themselves safe to reference in
  an unloaded state. Any other references are deemed unsafe and will be loaded,
  along with its recursive dependencies, regardless of if they match a
  defunload pattern or not. Note that these forcibly loaded defunloaded nodes
  may not fully participate in all systems that a regularly loaded node would.

  Args:
    new-node-id+resource-pairs
      A sequence of pairs of [node-id, resource] to return node-load-infos for.
      The node-ids do not need to exist in the graph, but they must be unique
      and not already taken by an existing node.

  Kv-args:
    :render-progress!
      Optional. A function that will be called to report progress as resources
      are read from disk.

    :resource-metrics
      Optional. A metrics-collector (see debug-util/make-metrics-collector) that
      will be updated with timings as resources are read from disk.

    :old-node-ids-by-proj-path
      Required for subsequent calls after the project has been loaded already.
      A map of proj-paths to the resource node-id that corresponded to that
      proj-path before the resource-sync. Used to look up information about the
      previous state of nodes that we may be about to replace with new nodes as
      part of the resource-sync. Should also contain entries for nodes that have
      been deleted earlier in the resource-sync.

    :old-node-id->old-node-state
      Required for subsequent calls after the project has been loaded already.
      A function from an old resource node-id in the old-node-ids-by-proj-path
      map to a keyword reflecting its state prior to the resource-sync. Will be
      used in the event that a .defunload file exists in the project and one of
      the patterns therein matches the proj-path of the read resource.

      Acceptable return values:
        :loaded
          The old node for the defunloaded resource was loaded before the
          resource-sync was triggered. We may have been forced to load it if a
          loaded resource references the defunloaded resource and its
          resource-type does not :allow-unloaded-use. If this ever happens, we
          will keep the node loaded in the graph, and must respond to external
          changes to it, and so on.

        :not-loaded
          The old node for the defunloaded resource had not ever been loaded
          before the resource-sync was triggered.

    :old-node-id->dependency-proj-paths
      Required for subsequent calls after the project has been loaded already.
      A function from an old resource node-id in the old-node-ids-by-proj-path
      map to any proj-paths it remains dependent on after the resource-sync. If
      the node-id provided to it is unknown, or was deleted at earlier stage of
      the resource-sync, it should return an empty sequence."
