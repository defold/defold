  "This creates a render-progress! function to be passed to a sub task.

  When creating a task using progress reporting you are responsible
  for splitting it into a number of steps. For instance one step per
  file processed. You then call render-progress! with a progress
  object containing a descriptive message, a size = number of steps,
  and a current pos = current step number.

  If you break out a sub task from a parent task, you need to decide
  how many steps the sub task represents. To the sub task, you pass a
  nested render progress function. This is created from the parents
  `render-progress!`, the parents current progress `parent-progress`,
  and a `span` - the number of parent steps steps the sub task
  represents. When returning from the sub task, the parent task should
  seem to have advanced `span` steps."
