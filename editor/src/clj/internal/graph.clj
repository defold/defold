;; A brief braindump on Overrides.
;;
;; Overrides is how we implement instancing or "templates" in the
;; editor. Currently it is used in collections for sub collections and
;; referenced game objects, in game objects for referenced components,
;; and in GUIs for templates (sub-GUIs) and layouts.
;;
;; What we want in "graphy" terms is a node that looks like some original
;; node - the thing being instantiated - except that we can change some
;; or all of its properties, or connect something else to its inputs.
;;
;; In most cases, the thing being instantiated is not implemented as a
;; single node, but rather one conceptual root node (often a resource
;; node) and a cluster of private helper nodes owned via :cascade-delete
;; inputs.
;;
;; An _override_ is a set of override nodes, each derived from an
;; original node. The set of nodes being _overridden_ is defined by a
;; traversal predicate and an original root node. When creating an
;; override, we start from the root node and recursively traverse the
;; :cascade-delete inputs "backwards" provided the arcs match the
;; traversal predicate, and for each node we reach - create a
;; corresponding override node. The purpose of the traversal predicate is
;; to make sure we cover the "hidden" private nodes - as far as
;; necessary.
;;
;; Once an _override_ has been created, the graph / transaction system
;; makes sure that any structural change to the original nodes is
;; reflected in the override. If we connect something to a
;; :cascade-delete input of a node that has been overridden, the
;; traversal will restart from that node and we might create a new
;; override node for the newly connected node. When disconnecting, any
;; corresponding override node will be deleted. Deleting the original
;; root node will delete the whole override.
;;
;; For override nodes, special rules apply for evaluation of properties
;; and finding input- and output arcs.
;;
;; The properties of override nodes report the same value as the
;; corresponding original, unless we explicitly set it to something else.
;; Once set, the new value will be reported. We can clear the property to
;; "revert" to the original behaviour - report the value of the original.
;;
;; For arcs, here are some reasonable expectations:
;;
;; * Creating an override should not affect the observable behaviour of
;; the original nodes. Any `node-value` should report the same value
;; before and after. There is an assumption here that the behaviour of
;; nodes never depend on what other nodes their outputs are connected to.
;;
;; * Just after creating an override, the override nodes should report
;; roughly the same property values (and output results) as their
;; corresponding original nodes - except for any node-id references and
;; the _properties output which f.e. contains information about the
;; original values.
;;
;; * Similar to how the property values work, we want to be able to connect
;; something else as input to an override node, and also revert to the
;; original input.
;;
;; For this to work, we introduced the idea of explicit and implicit
;; arcs.
;;
;; Any arc established with `connect` between override- or normal nodes
;; is an _explicit_ arc. Explicit arcs can also be `disconnect`'ed. If
;; you `connect` something else to a non-:array input, the old _explicit_
;; arc to that input is silently disconnected (deleted).
;;
;; An _implicit_ arc is derived from an _explicit_ or _implicit_ arc and
;; is only relevant for override nodes. You cannot `disconnect` an
;; _implicit_ arc. However, if you `connect` something else to an input
;; that used to have one or more _implicit_ arcs connected, the new
;; _explicit_ arc will shadow the _implicit_ arcs. For :array inputs,
;; connecting a single _explicit_ arc will shadow all _implicit_
;; arcs - you cannot selectively replace one of the incoming arcs. Later
;; `disconnect`ing the _explicit_ arc will effectively revert to the
;; _implicit_ arcs.
;;
;; The `node-value` mechanism does not differentiate between _explicit_
;; and _implicit_ arcs. When the value of an input is needed, we look for
;; all arcs (zero or one if non-:array input) connected to the input and
;; get the value(s) from the corresponding source node and output.
;;
;; In some cases one wants to find only the _explicit_ arcs, and for that
;; we have `explicit-outputs` and `-inputs`.
;;
;; How implicit arcs appear is described in examples below.
;;
;;
;; Example: Nodes O and I both included in an override. There may be
;; other nodes but we focus on O and I.
;;
;; (/override1 after a node means that node is an override node in the
;; override with id "override1". In practice overrides have numerical ids)
;;
;; Say we have two nodes O and I with an explicit arc between them:
;;
;;    O:output-label ---> I:input-label
;;
;; If we create an override including both nodes, we get this situation:
;;
;;    O/override1:output-label ~~~> I/override1:input-label
;;    |                             |
;;    V                             V
;;    O:output-label -------------> I:input-label
;;
;; Here, O is the original node of O/override1 and vice versa for I. The arc
;; between O and I is still _explicit_.
;;
;; Between O/override1 and I/override1 there is now an _implicit_
;; arc. This makes sense, because if we change a property of
;; O/override1 that value could affect I/override1. If we ask
;; O/override1 for its outgoing arcs from output-label, we should get
;; at least an arc to I/override1:input-label - and vice verse for
;; incoming arcs to I/override1:input-label. The outgoing arcs from
;; O:output-label however, should _not_ include
;; I/override1:input-label. Incoming arcs to I:input-label also
;; does not include O/override1:output-label.
;;
;;
;; Example: Nodes O and I, only I included in an override.
;;
;; Say only I is included in the override (we skip the override arrows):
;;
;;                     ~> I/override1:input-label
;;                    ~
;;                   ~
;;    O:output-label ---> I:input-label
;;
;; Here, an override was created but we were not really interested in
;; changing anything about O. In that case, it makes sense that
;; I/override1 "still" gets its input from O. Outgoing arcs from
;; O:output-label now include both I:input-label and I/override1:input-label,
;; but this should not affect the behaviour of O since it's an
;; output. Incoming arcs to I/override1:input-label is O:output-label.
;;
;;
;;
;; Example: Nodes O and I, only O included in an override.
;;
;;    O/override1:output-label
;;
;;
;;    O:output-label ---> I:input-label
;;
;; Here, since I was not included in the override, the most reasonable
;; option is to simply drop the arc. An _implicit_ connection between O/override1
;; and I could affect the behaviour of I - not what we want.
;;
;;
;;
;; Nodes can take part in several overrides, that is, have several
;; override nodes:
;;
;;     O/override1    O/override2   O/override3
;;     |              |             |
;;      \             V            /
;;       -----------> O <----------
;;
;; Also, we can create an override with an override node as root:
;;
;;                    O/override2
;;                    |
;;                    V
;;                    O/override1
;;                    |
;;                    V
;;                    O
;;
;; To complicate matters, there is no rule that an override may only
;; cover nodes "at the same level" - from the same override (or actual
;; real nodes).
;;
;;
;;                    O/template                I/template
;;                    |                         |
;;                    V                         |
;;                    O/landscape               |
;;                    |                         |
;;                    V                         V
;;                    O                         I
;;
;; Here, O/template and I/template are part of the same override
;; O/template also has an intermediate O/landscape override node along
;; its chain to the real node O.
;;
;;
;; This together also means that several override nodes in an override
;; can have a common original node along the chain towards the real node.
;;
;;
;;     O/override7    O/override7   O/override7
;;     |              |             |
;;     O/override5    |             |
;;     |              |             |
;;     O/override4    O/override6   |
;;     |              |             |
;;     O/override1    O/override2   O/override3
;;     |              |             |
;;      \             V            /
;;       -----------> O <----------
;;
;; To be precise, it's not enough to annotate the nodes with /"override
;; name" - the top nodes above are different nodes, and we should include
;; the whole override chain back to the real node.
;;
;;     O/override7,5,4,1  O/override7,6,2   O/override7,3
;;     |                  |                 |
;;    ...                ...               ...
;;
;;
;; These facts very much complicate the definition of _implicit_ arcs.
;;
;;
;;
;; Example: Implicit arcs where source override chain differs.
;;
;;    O/template,landscape    -> I/template
;;                           ~
;;                         ~
;;    O/landscape        ~
;;                     ~
;;                   ~
;;    O:output-label ---------> I:input-label
;;
;; Now, what produces input to I/template:input-label. Simple?
;; O:output-label. When we created the "landscape" override, we did not
;; include I. O/landscape does not affect I, and even though
;; O/template,landscape leads to O along the override chain - it's in no
;; way related to I/template. So there is an _implicit_ arc between
;; O:output-label and I/template:input-label.
;;
;;
;; Example: Implicit arcs where source override chain differs.
;;
;;    O/template2,template,landscape      I/template2,landscape
;;                                     ~>
;;                                  ~
;;    O/template,landscape      ~
;;                          ~
;;                      ~
;;    O/landscape    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~> I/landscape
;;
;;
;;    O:output-label -------------------> I:input-label
;;
;; This time, since I was included in the landscape override, there is an
;; _implicit_ arc between O/landscape:output-label and
;; I/landscape:input-label. This _implicit_ arc is still relevant for
;; I/template2, so there is also an _implicit_ arc between
;; O/landscape:output-label and I/template2,landscape:input-label.
;;
;;
;; Example: Implicit arcs where target override chain has intermediate overrides.
;;
;;    O/template2,template,landscape      I/template,landscape2,landscape1
;;                                   ~~~>
;;                               ~~~
;;    O/template,landscape2   ~~~
;;                         ~~~
;;                      ~~~
;;    O/landscape2  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>  I/landscape2,landscape1
;;
;;
;;                                  ~~~~> I/landscape1
;;                             ~~~~~
;;                       ~~~~~
;;    O:output-label -------------------> I:input-label
;;
;;
;; Here, as before there is an implicit arc O:output-label to
;; I/landscape1:input-label. What about I/landscape2,landscape1? Since
;; both O and I/landscape1 are included in the landscape2 override, the
;; implicit arc between them is still relevant for their override
;; nodes. Thus there is an implicit arc O/landscape2:output-label to
;; I/landscape2,landscape1:input-label. Further up, there is also an
;; implicit arc O/landscape2:output-label to
;; I/template,landscape2,landscape1:input-label.
;;
;;
;; Example: Implicit arcs where target override chain has intermediate overrides.
;;
;;    O/template,landscape2            ~> I/template,landscape2,square,landscape1
;;                                    ~
;;                                    ~
;;    O/landscape2                   ~ ~> I/landscape2,square,landscape1
;;                                   ~~
;;                                  ~
;;                        O/square ~~~~~> I/square,landscape1
;;
;;
;;                                 ~~~~~> I/landscape1
;;                            ~~~~~
;;                      ~~~~~~
;;    O:output-label -------------------> I:input-label
;;
;;
;; Here, similar to before, there is an implicit arc
;; O/square:output-label to I/square,landscape1:input-label. And
;; O/square remains the source for the implicit arcs to
;; I/landscape2,square,landscape1 and
;; I/template,landscape2,square,landscape1. Why isn't O/landscape2 etc
;; involved?
;; If we recreate this situation it becomes more clear:
;;
;; We start out with O and I, and an explicit arc between them.
;;
;; We create the landscape1 override, including only I. Since O was
;; not included, there will be an implicit arc between O and
;; I/landscape1.
;;
;; We create the square override, including both O and
;; I/landscape1. Since there is an implicit arc between O and
;; I/landscape1, there will be an implicit arc between their override
;; nodes O/square and I/square,landscape1.
;;
;; We create the landscape2 override, including the original O and
;; I/square,landscape1. Now, there is no arc between O and
;; I/square,landscape1. Thus, there is also no arc between
;; O/landscape2 and I/landscape2,square,landscape1. Instead
;; I/landscape2,square,landscape1 "still" has an implicit arc from
;; O/square.
;;
;; We create the template override, including O/landscape2 and
;; I/landscape2,square,landscape1. I/template,landscape2,square,landscape1
;; "still" has an implicit arc from O/square.
;;
;; The common rule in these examples is that for the implicit arcs to a
;; particular target node, the source node override chain should be the
;; longest and first possible subsequence of the target node override
;; chain.
