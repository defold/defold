  "Helpers for interacting with the YourKit Java profiler.

  Prerequisites:
  * The JVM must have been started with `-agentpath:<path-to-libyjpagent+opts>`.
  * `yjp-controller-api-redist.jar` must be on the classpath.

  You can achieve this by putting something like this in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:
  ```
  {:user {:jvm-opts [\"-agentpath:/Applications/YourKit-Java-Profiler-2023.5.app/Contents/Resources/bin/mac/libyjpagent.dylib=disablestacktelemetry,exceptions=disable\"]
          :resource-paths [\"/Applications/YourKit-Java-Profiler-2023.5.app/Contents/Resources/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar\"]}}
  ```"
  (:require [editor.process :as process])
  (:import [com.yourkit.api.controller AllocationRecordingSettings Controller CpuProfilingSettings]))
