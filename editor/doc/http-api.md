Editor HTTP API
===============

External tools can connect to the running editor and interact with it using a REST API.

### Caveats
* This HTTP API is currently in an experimental state. It might change drastically or even be removed completely if we deem it necessary. But hopefully it shouldn't come to that.
* Currently, the port is assigned randomly from a broad subrange. The editor will log the local endpoint url if started from a terminal.

### Overview
The editor can be interacted with by performing GET requests to the following URLs:
```
http://localhost:[port]/command
http://localhost:[port]/console
```

### The Command Endpoint
The command endpoint exposes a subset of the commands available from the editor menu bar. To trigger a command, perform an empty POST request to an URL in the format:
```
http://localhost:[port]/command/[command]
```
You can obtain a list of the available commands along with a short description in JSON format by making a GET request to `http://localhost:[port]/command`. At the time of writing, this returns:
```json

#### Response Codes
Commands are fire-and-forget. You will not know if a command succeeds or not, only if your request was accepted. As such, all command requests will return the same response codes. They are as follows:

* `202 Accepted` - The request was accepted and we are processing it. We use this instead of `200 OK` since we won't be able to tell you when it is done or how it went.
* `400 Bad Request` - The request was malformed.
* `403 Forbidden` - The command is supported, but it can't be executed right now (for example if a build is already in progress).
* `404 Not Found` - The string after `command/` is not a supported command.
* `405 Method Not Allowed` - The request method is invalid. For example, trying to GET a command or POST to the console.
* `500 Internal Server Error` - Something unexpected went wrong when executing the command. The error will be logged in the editor log.

### The Console Endpoint
The console endpoint allows external tools to obtain the current contents of the Console View in the editor. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:[port]/console` to obtain the console contents in JSON format. The returned object contains `lines` and `regions`.

* The `lines` are returned as an array of strings, each string representing a line in the Console.
* The `regions` contain metadata about sub-regions of the `lines` that can inform formatting, etc.

#### Region Objects
Each region object will be in the following format:
```json
{
  "from": {"row": 0, "col": 0},
  "to":   {"row": 0, "col": 42},
  "type": "repeat"
}
```
* `from` and `to` specify the row and columns that encompass the region as zero-based indices into the `lines`.
* `type` is the type of the region, and can inform formatting.

#### Region Types
Depending on the `type` of a region, it might have additional fields. Here is a non-exhaustive list of region types used in the editor.

* `eval-expression` - An expression posted from the Evaluate Lua field in the debugger.
* `eval-result` - The result returned by the `eval-expression`.
* `eval-error` - A runtime error resulting from an `eval-expression`.
* `extension-output` - Output from an editor script or extension.
* `extension-error` - Errors from an editor script or extension.
* `repeat` - Repeated console output that has been collapsed. Its `count` is the number of repeats.
* `resource-reference` - A substring that matches an existing path in the project. It has a `proj-path-candidates` array of project-relative paths to matching resources, and can also have a zero-based `row` index into the resource if it is text-based.

In particular, `resource-reference` regions could be made clickable to allow the user to  navigate to the source of a Lua error as the editor will attempt to parse this information from callstacks.
