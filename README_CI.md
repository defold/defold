# Continuous Integration

CI is based on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Current and old jobs can be seen on the [Actions page](https://github.com/defold/defold/actions) of the main Defold repository.

The Defold CI jobs are divided into three main categories, each represented by a separate GitHub Actions Workflow:

* [Editor Only](/.github/workflows/editor-only.yml) - Builds editor feature branches (branches starting with `DEFEDIT-`)
* [Main](/.github/workflows/main-ci.yml) - Builds and tests changes to all other branches. The workflow varies slightly depending on the type of branch being built (dev, beta, master or a feature branch).
* [Engine Nightly](/.github/workflows/engine-nightly.yml) - Runs Address Sanitizer (ASAN) and Valgrind nightly to detect leaks and other problems. This is done on the `dev` branch.

The workflow files listed above sets up the jobs and distributes them to multiple workers to build, test and release the engine and/or editor. The bulk of the work is done in the [ci.py](/ci/ci.py) script.

## How to trigger builds manually

You can use the `ci/trigger-build.py` script to manually trigger a build using the `Main` workflow:

```
./ci/trigger-build.py --token=<personal_access_token> --branch=9a32ac5e9513e8aff669cf4cbe4334aeec2fbf8e --skip-engine --skip-sdk --skip-bob
```

Available options are:

```
$ ./ci/trigger-build.py --help                                                                   
usage: trigger-build.py [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--action ACTION]
                        [--branch BRANCH] [--skip-engine] [--skip-sdk]
                        [--skip-bob] [--skip-editor]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN    GitHub API personal access token
  --action ACTION  The trigger action
  --branch BRANCH  The branch to build
  --skip-engine    Skip building the engine
  --skip-sdk       Skip building the Defold SDK
  --skip-bob       Skip building bob
  --skip-editor    Skip building the editor
```
