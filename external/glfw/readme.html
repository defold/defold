<a name="intro">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to version 2.7.1 of the GLFW OpenGL framework.  GLFW is a free, open
source, portable framework for OpenGL application development.  In short, it is
a library that provides a powerful API for handling operating system specific
tasks, such as opening an OpenGL window, reading keyboard, mouse, joystick and
time input, creating threads, and more.</p>

<p>GLFW 2.7 is expected to be the last major release of the 2.x series, with
most development now being done on what will become version 3.0.</p>

<p>This release only adds bug fixes for a number of minor issues in 2.7.</p>


<a name="compiling">
<h2>2. Compiling GLFW and the example programs</h2>

<p>A top level makefile can be found in the root directory of the GLFW
distribution that has been designed to work with several compilers. If you
simply enter the GLFW root directory in a shell and type <code>make</code> (or
<code>nmake</code> or <code>gmake</code>, depending on the name of your make
tool), and a list should appear with the currently supported options for
systems and compilers.</p>

<p>For example, one of the options is to compile GLFW for Windows with the
LCC-Win32 C compiler, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote><code>make win32-lcc</code></blockquote>

<p>That will compile the GLFW static link library and the supplied example
programs. For Windows compilers, a Win32 DLL will also be compiled.</p>

<p>Currently supported compilers and systems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 and later</li>
  <li>MSYS or Cygwin for Windows</li>
  <li>Bare MinGW for Windows</li>
  <li>LCC-Win32 for Windows</li>
  <li>OpenWatcom for Windows</li>
  <li>MinGW cross-compilation for Unix or Unix-like systems</li>
  <li>Unix or Unix-like systems running the X Window System</li>
  <li>Apple GCC or Clang on Mac OS X</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also project files available for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 and
2010 in the <code>support/msvc90</code> and <code>support/msvc100</code>
directories.</p>

<p>If your compiler/system is not in the list, you may have to create new
makefiles in the <code>lib\win32</code>, <code>lib/x11</code> or
<code>lib/cocoa</code> directory, and in the <code>examples</code> directory.
If you have any problems, please use our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/forums/forum/247562">support forum</a>
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=72569&atid=534938">bug tracker</a>
on SourceForge.net. We would like to support as many systems as possible, so if
you had to make any modifications or additions to the source and/or makefiles
in order to make GLFW compile successfully, we would very much like to know
what you had to do.</p>


<h3>2.1 Microsoft Windows</h3>

<p>When building GLFW as a DLL (dynamic link library), all compilation units
need to have the <code>GLFW_BUILD_DLL</code> macro defined.  All build methods
listed below already does this, but you need to do it yourself if you are
making a custom build.  Without this macro, the GLFW DLL will not export
functions correctly and code calling the DLL will be incorrectly generated.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 and later</h4>

<p>Project files for both the static and dynamic versions of the GLFW library
are provided in the <code>support/msvc90</code> and
<code>support/msvc100</code> directories.</p>


<h4>2.1.2 MSYS or Cygwin on Windows</h4>

<p>GLFW can be cross-compiled to native Win32 code using the Cygwin
environment.  The Cygwin build path will also work on MinGW with MSYS.</p>

<p>Open a Cygwin or MSYS shell, enter the GLFW root directory and run make with
the <code>win32-cygwin</code> target.</p>


<h4>2.1.3 Bare MinGW on Windows</h4>

<p>GLFW can be compiled using only bare bone MinGW, using the Windows
command-line environment for file management.  Open a regular command prompt,
enter the GLFW root directory and run the MinGW make program
<code>mingw32-make</code> with the <code>win32-mingw</code> target.</p>


<h4>2.1.4 OpenWatcom on Windows</h4>

<p>GLFW can be compiled using <a href="http://www.openwatcom.org/">OpenWatcom</a>
for Windows by running the following in the GLFW root directory:</p>

<blockquote><code>nmake MAKE=nmake win32-ow</code></blockquote>

<p>Also make sure that you have all your environment variables set up
correctly.  It is the default option when installing OpenWatcom to permanently
set up all the required environment variables.  If <code>nmake</code> is
unavailable, you probably have to run <code>WATCOM\setvars.bat</code> from the
command prompt first, where <code>WATCOM</code> is the directory in which you
installed OpenWatcom (e.g. <code>C:\Watcom</code>).</p>


<h4>2.1.5 MinGW cross-compilation for Unix or Unix-like systems</h4>

<p>Some Unix-like systems have a MinGW cross-compilation package for compiling
native Win32 binaries, for example the <code>mingw32</code> package on Debian
GNU/Linux and its derivatives.  You can use this to build Win32 binaries of
GLFW and all examples without having to run Microsoft Windows.  Use the regular
make program with the <code>cross-mgw</code> target.  These binaries are also
regularly tested with Wine.</p>


<h3>2.2 X11 on Unix-like systems</h3>

<p>Compiler and link library capabilities are auto-detected with a script
called <code>compile.sh</code>.  Note that you don't need to run this script
yourself, as it is run automatically when necessary.  It has been tested under
Ubuntu Linux, Slackware Linux, Debian GNU/Linux and others and should
hopefully run on the majority of available Unix-like systems and generate
functional Makefiles.  You do not have to run the script manually, since it is
called from the top-level makefile.</p>

<p>If you wish to customize the compilation or link flags for GLFW, set the
<code>CFLAGS</code> or <code>LFLAGS</code> environment variables as needed
before building the library.  These flags will be picked up and added to the
generated <code>Makefile.x11</code> files.</p>

<p>If you wish to use a certain compiler, set the <code>CC</code> environment
variable before building the library.  This will also be stored in the
generated <code>Makefile.x11</code> files.</p>

<p>If you have already configured your source tree, you can reset it to an
un-configured state by running make with the <code>x11-dist-clean</code>
target.</p>

<p>If you are making your own build setup for GLFW, you need to be aware of the
various preprocessor symbols that the bundled makefiles use to enable various
features and code paths.  They need to be defined either on the command-line or
at the very beginning for each GLFW source file with an <code>x11_</code>
prefix.</p>

<p>Note that the X11 port of GLFW compiles on Mac OS X, but is currently unable
to open a window when running against X11.app, due to Apple's incomplete
implementation of GLXFBConfigs.</p>

<h3>2.3 Apple GCC or Clang on Mac OS X</h3>

<p>To compile GLFW for Mac OS X, you will need to have installed the Developer
Tools.  A version of these tools can be found on your Mac OS X disc, with newer
versions available from the Apple Developer Connection site.  When they are
installed, simply open Terminal and go to the root GLFW directory.  From there,
you can build the library and all the examples by running make with the
appropriate target, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote><code>make cocoa</code></blockquote>

<p>The default compiler for the Cocoa port of GLFW is <code>cc</code>, which as
of Mac OS X 10.6 still defaults to GCC, but you can override this using the
<code>CC</code> environment variable.  For example, to build GLFW using Clang,
use:</p>

<blockquote><code>env CC=clang make cocoa</code></blockquote>

<p>There is also a deprecated Carbon port of GLFW, which is limited to
32-bit code and only runs well on Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4.  However, if you
need to build applications for those systems, it is a better choice than
the Cocoa port, which uses APIs unavailable on systems older than 10.5.</p>


<a name="installing">
<h2>3. Installing GLFW</h2>

<h3>3.1 Windows</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW with MinGW or Cygwin, three files of interest should
have appeared in the <code>lib\win32</code> directory. They are:
<code>libglfw.a</code> (the static link version of GLFW), <code>glfw.dll</code>
(the DLL version of GLFW) and <code>libglfwdll.a</code> (the DLL import
library).</p>

<p>To install GLFW on Cygwin (and possibly MinGW), run make with the
<code>cygwin-install</code> target.  This will generate the pkg-config file and
copy it, the header file and the library to the correct locations of your
Cygwin installation. If you wish to change the installation location from its
default, set the desired prefix path with the environment variable
<code>PREFIX</code>.</p>

<p>If you used Borland C++ Builder, LCC-Win32, Microsoft Visual C++ or
OpenWatcom, the files are named <code>glfw.lib</code> (the static link version
of GLFW), <code>glfw.dll</code> (the DLL version of GLFW) and
<code>glfwdll.lib</code> (the DLL import library).</p>

<p>The static link library and the DLL import library should be copied to your
compiler's <code>LIB</code> directory (where all other link libraries are
located).  The DLL can be copied either to your Windows system directory (where
opengl32.dll is located), or to the project directory of your GLFW-based
projects (where you place your executable files).</p>

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <code>include\GL\glfw.h</code>,
to the <code>GL</code> directory of your compiler's include directory (i.e.
where <code>gl.h</code>, <code>glu.h</code> etc. are located).</p>


<h3>3.2 Unix</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, three files named <code>libglfw.pc.in</code>,
<code>libglfw.a</code> and <code>libglfw.so</code> should have appeared in the
<code>lib/x11</code> directory. This is the pkg-config template file, the GLFW
static link library and the GLFW shared library, respectively.</p>

<p>To install GLFW onto your system, run make as root with the
<code>x11-install</code> make target. This will install the pkg-config file, the
static library and the header. By default, the files will be installed under
<code>/usr/local</code>. If you wish to install to a different location, set the
<code>PREFIX</code> environment variable appropriately when running make.</p>

<p>Note that the shared library is not installed by default, as you really
should think twice before using it. GLFW is very small and shared library
distribution on Unix outside of packaging systems is quite tricky. The GLFW
license also allows static linking without requiring you to share your
code.</p>

<p>However, if you're a *nix distribution packager, use a language binding or
for some other reason wish to install the shared library along with the rest,
run make with the <code>x11-distro-install</code> target.</p>


<h3>3.4 Mac OS X</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, three files named <code>libglfw.pc.in</code>,
<code>libglfw.a</code> and <code>libglfw.dylib</code> should appear in the
<code>lib/cocoa</code> directory. This is the pkg-config template file, the GLFW
static link library and the GLFW dynamic library, respectively.</p>

<p>To install GLFW onto your system, run make with sudo and the
<code>cocoa-install</code> build target, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote><code>sudo make cocoa-install</code></blockquote>

<p>This will install the pkg-config file, the static library and the header. By
default, the files will be installed under <code>/usr/local</code>. If you wish
to install to a different location, set the environment variable
<code>PREFIX</code> appropriately when running make.</p>

<p>Note that the shared library is not installed by default, as you really
should think twice before using it. GLFW is very small and very suitable for
static linking. The GLFW license also allows static linking without requiring
your to share your code.</p>

<a name="using">
<h2>4. Using GLFW</h2>

<p>There are two aspects to using GLFW:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How does the GLFW API work</li>
  <li>How to compile programs that use GLFW</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is covered in the
<a href="docs/UsersGuide.pdf">GLFW Users Guide</a> and the
<a href="docs/Reference.pdf">GLFW Reference Manual</a>, and we suggest that you
read at least the Users Guide, since it's a good introduction to the GLFW
API.</p>

<p>Designing and compiling programs that use GLFW is not very difficult.
A few rules for successfully designing GLFW-based programs are presented
in the following sections.</p>

<h3>4.1 Include the GLFW header file</h3>

<p>In the files of your program where you use OpenGL or GLFW, you should
include the <code>GL/glfw.h</code> header file, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote><code>#include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;</code></blockquote>

<p>This defines all the constants, types and function prototypes of the GLFW
API.  It also includes the <code>gl.h</code> and </code>GL/glu.h</code> header
files, and - this is very important - <em>it defines all the necessary
constants and types that are necessary for the OpenGL headers to work on
different platforms</em>.</p>

<p>For example, under Microsoft Windows you are normally required to include
<code>windows.h</code> before you include <code>GL/gl.h</code>.  This would
however make your code dependent on the Windows platform, or at least require
your program to check which platform it is being compiled on.

The GLFW header file takes care of this for you, not by including
<code>windows.h</code>, but rather by itself duplicating the necessary parts of
it.  This way, the namespace won't be cluttered by the entire Windows API.</p>

<p>In other words:
<ul>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> include <code>GL/gl.h</code> or <code>GL/glu.h</code>
      yourself, as GLFW does this for you</li>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> include <code>windows.h</code> unless you actually need
      direct access to the Windows API</li>
  <li>If you <em>do</em> need to include <code>windows.h</code>, do it
      <em>before</em> including <code>GL/glfw.h</code> and the GLFW header will
      detect this.</p>
</ul>

<p>Also note that if you are using an OpenGL extension loading library such as
<a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a>, you should include the GLEW
header <em>before</em> the GLFW one.  The GLEW header defines macros that
disable any <code>gl.h</code> that the GLFW header includes and GLEW will work
as expected.</p>



<h3>4.2 Link with the right libraries</h3>

<h4>4.2.1 Windows static library</h4>

<p>If you link with the static version of GLFW, it is also necessary to
link with some system libraries that GLFW uses.</p>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the static version of GLFW,
you must also link with the following libraries: <code>opengl32</code>,
<code>user32</code> and <code>kernel32</code>. Some of these libraries may be
linked with by default by your compiler. In the table below you can see the
minimum required link options for each supported Windows compiler (you may want
to add other libraries as well, such as <code>glu32</code>):</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Compiler</b></td>
    <td><b>Link options</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Borland C++ Builder</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cygwin</td>
    <td><i>See Unix static library below</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCC-Win32</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft Visual C++</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MinGW32</td>
    <td><code>-lglfw -lopengl32</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenWatcom</td>
    <td><code>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4>4.2.2 Windows DLL</h4>

<p>To compile a program that uses the DLL version of GLFW, you need to
define the <code>GLFW_DLL</code> constant. This can either be done with a
compiler switch, typically by adding <code>-DGLFW_DLL</code> to the list of
compiler options. You can also do it by adding the following line to all your
source files <b>before</b> including the GLFW header file:</p>

<blockquote><code>#define GLFW_DLL</code></blockquote>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the DLL version of GLFW,
the only library you need to link with for GLFW to work is <code>glfwdll</code>.
In the table below you can see the minimum required link options for each
supported Windows compiler (you may want to add other libraries as well,
such as <code>opengl32</code> and <code>glu32</code>):</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Compiler</b></td>
    <td><b>Link options</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Borland C++ Builder</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cygwin</td>
    <td><code>-lglfwdll</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCC-Win32</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft Visual C++</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MinGW32</td>
    <td><code>-lglfwdll</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenWatcom</td>
    <td><code>glfwdll.lib</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>



<h4>4.2.3 Unix static library</h4>

<p>GLFW supports
<a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkg-config</a>,
and a <code>libglfw.pc</code> file is generated and installed when you install
the library.  For systems that do not provide pkg-config, you should look in
this file for the proper compile and link flags for your system, as determined
by compile.sh at compile time.</p>

<p>A typical compile and link command-line may look like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>cc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</code></blockquote>

<p>If you use GLU functions in your program you should also add
<code>-lGLU</code> to your link flags.</p>



<h4>4.2.5 Mac OS X static library</h4>

<p>When compiling and linking a program under Mac OS X that uses GLFW, you
must also link with Cocoa and OpenGL frameworks.

<p>If you are using Xcode, you simply add the GLFW library <code>libglfw.a</code> and
these frameworks to your project. If, however, you are building your program
from the command-line, there are two methods for correctly linking your GLFW
program.</p>

<p>GLFW supports
<a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkg-config</a>, and a
libglfw.pc file is generated and installed when you install the library. You
can find pkg-config in most packaging systems, such as
<a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, so if you have one of them
installed, simply install pkg-config. Once you have pkg-config available, the
command-line for compiling and linking your program is:</p>

<blockquote><code>cc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</code></blockquote>

<p>If you do not wish to use pkg-config, you will need to add the required
frameworks and libraries to your command-line using the <code>-l</code> and
<code>-framework</code> switches, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote><code>cc -o myprog myprog.c -lglfw -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL</code></blockquote>

<p>Note that you do not add the .framework extension to a framework when adding
it from the command-line.</p>

<p>These frameworks contain all OpenGL and GLU functions, so there is no need to
add additional libraries or frameworks when using GLU functionality. Also note
that even though your machine may have Unix-style OpenGL libraries, they are for
use with the X Window System, and will <em>not</em> work with the Mac OS X native
version of GLFW.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Preliminary native Mac OS X support (via the Carbon interface)</li>
 <li>Preliminary DOS support (DJGPP + Mesa)</li>
 <li>Changed license to the zlib license (almost identical to the previous
     GLFW license), so now GLFW is OSI Certified</li>
 <li>Rewrote the GLFW documentation in LaTeX, meaning several improvements
     (both visual and practical)</li>

     support for various languages</li>
 <li>[Win32] Added OpenWatcom compiler support (thanks Sebastian
     Schuberth!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Changed fallback timer from GetTickCount to timeGetTime,
     which usually provides better resolution</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Accumulator buffer selection should be more
     robust</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: If stereo rendering is requested, and no stereo pixel
     format could be created, glfwOpenWindow now fails</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwSetWindowSize now sets the size of the client
     area, NOT the entire window, meaning that there is a 1:1 relationship
     between glfwSetWindowSize and glfwGetWindowSize</li>
 <li>[X11] Added FreeBSD and QNX support</li>
 <li>[X11] Added support for non-pthread capable systems</li>

     released</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification of fullscreen windows should now work
     properly</li>

<h3>v2.4.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added AmigaOS support (preliminary)</li>
 <li>GLFW for the X Window System now works under Mac OS X</li>

     instead of seconds</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile under IRIX v5.3</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile with Kylix</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.4</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Major source code rearrangement - much code is now shared between
     different platforms, and it should be easier to port GLFW to new
     platforms</li>
 <li>Added a Unicode keyboard text input interface (CharCallback)</li>
 <li>Keyboard key input is now slightly more internationalized: GLFW now
     uses 8-bit ISO-8859-1 encoding for keys representing printable
     characters (e.g. &quot;&Ouml;&quot;, &quot;&#167;&quot;, etc), as
     opposed to the previous 7-bit US-ASCII encoding</li>
 <li>Added more key constants (F13-F25, keypad '=')</li>
 <li>Added an enable/disable swicth for automatic event polling from
     glfwSwapBuffers</li>

     in the system (if POSIX sysconf is not supported)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: compile.sh now works with Sun sh (and hopefully others
     too)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: compile.sh now detects the need for -ldl when dlopen is
     used</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: When closing a fullscreen window under Win 9x/NT4,
     the task bar icon now disappears properly</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile on a wider range of MSVC
     compilers (e.g. .NET) - Thanks Tim Little!</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Removed the silly limitation of 100 threads (the thread information
     is now kept in a linked list)</li>
 <li>General source cleanup (window state is now kept in a single
     struct, plus some other minor changes)</li>
 <li>[X11] Added Solaris gethrtime() support (not tested yet), which
     should give an improved timer for Sun/Solaris stations</li>
 <li>[X11] Some fixes to the 'compile.sh' script (-O for non-gcc compilers
     and 'make x11-gcc' should now really force GCC)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] A minimalist configuration script was added that solves the
     issue with glXGetProcAddressARB, and unifies all Unix/X11 Makefiles
     into one template Makefile (well, one for GLFW, and one for the
     examples)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added OpenGL stereo rendering support</li>
 <li>Added a function for parsing the OpenGL version string
     (glfwGetGLVersion)</li>
 <li>[x86] Bugfix: Hopefully the CPU core clock dependent timer RDTSC will
     never be used on CPUs with variable core frequencies anymore</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW could create stereo rendering capable windows,
     even if it was not requested (GLFW v2.2.x did not support selection
     of stereo rendering)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetProcAddress returned NULL on most systems (even
     on those that supported glXGetProcAddressARB). Now GLFW assumes that
     glXGetProcAddressARB is supported on all systems, which solves the
     bug, but may result in compiler errors on some systems (please let me
     know if you have any related problems).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Bugfix: Checking for GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap is more robust</li>
 <li>Bugfix: glfwLoadTexture2D will now fail if no window is opened</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Right shift was not detected under Win 9x/ME (it is
     still not as good as under NT/2K/XP, but at least you get right
     shifts)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Visuals are now selected more accurately. For instance,
     glfwOpenWindow will no longer fail if you request a 24-bit color
     buffer if only 16-bit color visuals are available (which means that
     pong3d should work on 16-bit displays).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Windows did not always get focus (this was a tough
     one!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwGetWindowParam did not work with
     GLFW_ACCUM_*_BITS or GLFW_AUX_BUFFERS</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Linux joystick Y axis positions were reversed</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] Added joystick support for Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added joystick support (only supported under Windows so far)</li>
 <li>Added joystick controls to pong3d.c (only 3 more lines of code)</li>
 <li>Added glfwOpenWindowHint() function</li>
 <li>It is now possible to specify a desired vertical monitor refresh
     rate (for fullscreen windows)</li>
 <li>It is now possible to request an accumulator buffer and auxiliary
     buffers</li>
 <li>Added glfwSetTime() function</li>
 <li>Added a GLFW conversion of the MESA/GLUT gears.c demo to the example
     programs</li>
 <li>[Win32] gdi32.dll and winmm.dll are now loaded dynamically when
     glfwInit() is called. This means that there is no need to link with
     gdi32.lib or winmm.lib when using the static version of GLFW, which
     should make GLFW usage more convenient.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Greatly improved keyboard input (detect left/right
     CTRL etc)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwExtensionSupported now detects all WGL extensions
     (e.g. WGL_ARB_pbuffer)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse cursor was not re-hidden when a GLFW window was
     deselected and then selected again (with ALT+TAB)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Minor bug in the SGI timer - and ugly (unintended) SGI
     timer debug info removed</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetDesktopMode and glfwGetVideoModes no longer give
     segmentation faults if no X server is available</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added image and texture loading capabilities (support for the TGA
     file format at the moment)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program (mipmaps.c) for showing off the automatic
     mipmap generation and texture loading capabilities of GLFW 2.1</li>
 <li>Removed the separate TGA loader (tga.c in the examples directory)
     since texture loading is supported natively by GLFW. Also updated the
     Pong3D demo to use GLFW texture loading instead of tga.c.</li>
 <li>Improved keyboard handling (e.g. numeric keypad keys can be
     detected)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program, keytest.c</li>
 <li>Changed the GLFWvidmode structure and the corresponding API functions
     to report pure color bits instead of the confusing (and unportable)
     "BPP" field</li>
 <li>Changed glfwSetWindowSize so that it operates in fullscreen mode
     too</li>
 <li>Added mouse wheel support under Windows (not Win95) and X11</li>
 <li>Added window iconification functions (glfwInconifyWindow and
     glfwRestoreWindow)</li>
 <li>Improved iconification and deactivation handling under both Windows
     and X11</li>
 <li>Made it possible to turn on/off key repeat (the default is now no key
     repeat)</li>
 <li>Added SGI hardware timer support (CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE) for improved
     timer resolution for SGI computers</li>
 <li>Added support for the free Borland C++ Builder 5.x compiler for
     Windows</li>
 <li>Made it possible to compiler GLFW as a Windows DLL using any of the
     supported compilers</li>
 <li>Some constants have changed names (e.g. GLFW_REDBITS is now called
     GLFW_RED_BITS)</li>
 <li>Updated GLFW documentation (GLFW Users Guide and GLFW Reference
     Manual) to reflect the changes in the API</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Corrected Cygwin toplevel makefile entry</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed event lag bug</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed Radeon 8500 crash</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Fixed the window close bug</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification/deactivation is now detected</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Non-OpenGL visuals are not listed anymore</li>
 <li>[XFree86] Bugfix: Undesired video mode changes are now prevented</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added precise CPU cycle based timing support (RDTSC) for x86
     CPUs (under both Windows and Unix)</li>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for Windows with Cygwin</li>
 <li>Corrected the CC for Unix/X11 makefiles (-Wall is usually not a
     supported flag for CC, so it was removed from the CFLAGS list)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for X11 with 'cc' rather than
     'gcc' (useful for IRIX users for instance).</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse coordinates are now relative to the window
     upper left corner, which also means that disabling the mouse cursor
     in windowed mode should work much better.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Added a bunch of more keys that are recognized by
     GLFW.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetNumberOfProcessors now works for IRIX (earlier
     versions of GLFW would not compile under IRIX).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>glfwTerminate() will now be called automatically upon normal program
     termination (using atexit())</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Buffer-swapping did not work if a window lost
     focus.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Top level Makefile did not work under Windows
     9x.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: NULL declaratoin in glfw.h was not MSVC 7.x
     compatible.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW would not build with C++ (e.g. g++).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0</h3>
