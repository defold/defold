/*# LuaSocket API documentation
 *
 * [LuaSocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket) is a Lua extension library that provides
 * support for the TCP and UDP transport layers. Defold provides the "socket" namespace in
 * runtime, which contain the core C functionality. Additional LuaSocket support modules for
 * SMTP, HTTP, FTP etc are not part of the core included, but can be easily added to a project
 * and used.
 *
 * Note the included helper module "socket.lua" in "builtins/scripts/socket.lua". Require this
 * module to add some additional functions and shortcuts to the namespace:
 *
 * ```lua
 * require "builtins.scripts.socket"
 * ```

/*# waits for a number of sockets to change status
 *
 * The function returns a list with the sockets ready for reading, a list with the sockets ready for writing and an error message. The error message is "timeout" if a timeout condition was met and nil otherwise. The returned tables are doubly keyed both by integers and also by the sockets themselves, to simplify the test if a specific socket has changed status.
 *
 * `Recvt` and `sendt` parameters can be empty tables or `nil`. Non-socket values (or values with non-numeric indices) in these arrays will be silently ignored.
 *
 * The returned tables are doubly keyed both by integers and also by the sockets themselves, to simplify the test if a specific socket has changed status.
 *
 * [icon:attention] This function can monitor a limited number of sockets, as defined by the constant socket._SETSIZE. This number may be as high as 1024 or as low as 64 by default, depending on the system. It is usually possible to change this at compile time. Invoking select with a larger number of sockets will raise an error.
 *
 * [icon:attention] A known bug in WinSock causes select to fail on non-blocking TCP sockets. The function may return a socket as writable even though the socket is not ready for sending.
 *
 * [icon:attention] Calling select with a server socket in the receive parameter before a call to accept does not guarantee accept will return immediately. Use the settimeout method or accept might block forever.
 *
 * [icon:attention] If you close a socket and pass it to select, it will be ignored.
 *
 * (Using select with non-socket objects: Any object that implements `getfd` and `dirty` can be used with select, allowing objects from other libraries to be used within a socket.select driven loop.)
 *
 * @name socket.select
 * @param recvt [type:table] array with the sockets to test for characters available for reading.
 * @param sendt [type:table] array with sockets that are watched to see if it is OK to immediately write on them.
 * @param [timeout] [type:number] the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a change in status. Nil, negative or omitted timeout value allows the function to block indefinitely.
 *
 * @return sockets_r [type:table] a list with the sockets ready for reading.
 * @return sockets_w [type:table] a list with the sockets ready for writing.
 * @return error [type:string|nil] an error message. "timeout" if a timeout condition was met, otherwise `nil`.
