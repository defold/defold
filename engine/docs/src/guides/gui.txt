GUI
===

Defold provides you with a custom GUI editor and powerful scripting possibilities that is tailor made for the construction and implementation of user interfaces.

A graphical user interface in Defold is a game object component that you build and attach to a game object and place in a collection. This component has the following properties:

* It has simple, but powerful, layout features that allow resolution and aspect ratio independent rendering of your user interface.
* It can have logic behavior attached to it through a gui script.
* It is rendered in a separate pass from the rest of the game, on top of other content. 
* It is rendered against a screen-space coordinate system that is independent of camera view. Even if you have a moving camera will GUI elements stay put on the screen.

[NOTE]
====
The rendering behavior can be changed in the render script but it is usually desirable to have it that way since the user interface is a separate visual "layer" on top of the game view and you usually want HUD items and menus on certain spots on screen.

====

Because the GUI is not part of the collection’s coordinate system but is rendered independently of the game view it is not placed in a particular location in the collection editor and it has no visual representation in the collection editor. However, the GUI component have to reside in a game object that has a location in the collection. Changing that location has no effect on the GUI.

== Nodes

A GUI component is built up by a set of nodes. A node is a visual object that is either:

   * A box filled with a color or texture
   * A piece of text written in a particular color with a particular font

Nodes are similar to game objects inside a collection but they don’t contain any logic. They can be translated (moved) and ordered in parent-child hierarchies either in the editor or at runtime through scripting. Nodes can also be animated with script (see <<anchor-a, Animation>> below).

You have direct access to all nodes in your GUI component from the script code.
Add nodes by right-clicking on the "Nodes" folder and selecting either "Add Box" or "Add Text".

image::images/gui/gui_add_nodes.png["Add nodes", align="center"]

You can also use the GUI top menu, or the keyboard shortcuts ‘I’ and ‘O’.
Placed nodes are moved and rotated in the same way game objects are translated in the collection editor.

=== Node properties

Each node has an extensive set of properties that control its appearance:

   * Position, Rotation, Scale, Size (can be animated)
   * Color, Outline, Shadow (can be animated)
   * Blend mode
   * Adjust mode, Pivot, Xanchor, Yanchor
   * Font, Text, Line-break
   * Index, Layer, Parent

These properties can be modified in the editor's properties tab (except index and parenting), or through script (see link:/ref/gui[Gui api reference]).

Each of these properties can also be animated in script (see <<anchor-a, Animation>> below).

=== Index—rendering order

All nodes are rendered in the order they are listed under the "Nodes" folder. The node on top of the list is drawn first and will appear behind any other node. The last node in the list is drawn last, meaning it will appear in front of all other nodes. Drag nodes in the list to change the index order.

You can also change and group the ordering of nodes with layers (see below).

If you set the Z-value on a node the draw order will not change. The Z-values on nodes are ignored.

=== Parent-child hierarchies

A node is made the child of another node by dragging it onto the node that you wish to be the child´s parent. A node with a parent inherits the transform (change in position, rotation and scale) applied to the parent and relative to the parent pivot (see below). Children are drawn after their parents, so they will appear in front of the parent node. Use layers to change the draw order of parent and child nodes and to optimize the rendering of nodes (see "Batch rendering" below)

== Textures

You can use textures as part of your interface. These textures must be added to the GUI component. Any image that has been added to the project is available for addition to the GUI component’s textures. You add textures either by right clicking the "Textures" folder, through the "GUI" top menu, or with keyboard shortcuts.

Textures that has been added to the GUI can then be applied to box nodes.

image::images/gui/gui_texture.png["Textures", align="center"]

Note that the color of the box node will tint the texture. The tint color is multiplied onto the texture, meaning that if you set the color to white (the default) no tint is applied.

image::images/gui/gui_tinted_texture.png["Tinted texture", align="center"]

The color of the node is scriptable and can be animated:

[source-code]
----
local transparent = vmath.vector4(0, 0, 0, 0)
local white = vmath.vector4(1, 1, 1, 1)
gui.set_color(node, transparent)
gui.animate(node, gui.COLOR, white, gui.EASING_INOUTQUAD, 0.5)
----

== Fonts

The fonts that you wish to use in your GUI must be added to the GUI component. Either right-click the "Fonts" folder, use the "GUI" top menu or press the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

image::images/gui/gui_fonts.png["Fonts", align="center"]

== Layers

Layers give fine grained control over how nodes are drawn. If you assign a layer to a node it will be drawn as part of that layer. The layer drawing order takes precedence over the regular node order.

image::images/gui/gui_layers.png["Layers", align="center"]

In this example the orange box node "box2" is part of layer "front" which is drawn last according to the layer order list. This means that all nodes that are part of "front" will be drawn on top of nodes that are part of layer "back" and nodes without layers set.

Both "box1" and "box3" are set to layer "back". The drawing order within a layer is determined by the node’s index, it’s place in the node list. "box1" comes before "box3" and is thus drawn first, behind "box3".

=== Batch rendering
In order to render your gui as efficiently as possible, there are steps that you can take that will permit the engine to organise drawing of your gui nodes in batches, reducing the overall number of drawcalls that the engine must create. If groups of nodes meet the following conditions, then they may be handled within a single batch:

. If they are all box nodes, they use the same texture.
. If they are text nodes, they use same font.
. They must be rendered in sequence. That means that they must appear next to each other in the node list, or be part of the same layer (see the example below for details)

The ability to arrange nodes in hierarchies is powerful and makes it easy to group complex hierarchies of nodes into manageable units. But hierarchies can effectively break batch rendering. Let’s look at a simple example:

image::images/gui/gui_batch_hierarchy.png["Batch hierarchy", align="center"]

Here we have built two buttons each out of three nodes. We have a box node with a shadow texture, a box node with a shaded button texture and a text node with the button text. We have put these nodes in logical manageable hierarchies.

When the rendering pipeline walks through the list of nodes, it is forced to set up a separate batch for each node. This is because walking through the list each node has a different texture or font to the previous; thus these two buttons will thus require six separate batches.

We can do better, though. By carefully assigning layers to our nodes, we can render our buttons much more efficiently. For this example we create three layers:

   . Shadow
   . Button
   . Text

We assign the nodes to the corresponding layer and make sure the layers are placed in correct render order in the Layers-list:

image::images/gui/gui_batch_layers.png["Batch layers", align="center"]

Since the layer drawing order takes precedence over the regular node order the nodes are now drawn in the following order:

   . play_block_shadow
   . quit_block_shadow
   . play_block
   . quit_block
   . play
   . quit

The nodes that share a texture or font now sit adjacent to each other and the rendering pipeline can batch these nodes into three batches instead of six. A 50% performance win.

Now, imagine that we scale our little example up and expand the GUI to 10 buttons. If we make sure to properly assign the right layer to each new nodes, the engine will still render them in three batches—this time instead of 30.

== Script

To control the logic of your GUI and animate nodes you use Lua scripts. GUI scripts work the same as regular game object scripts, but are saved as a different file type and have access to a different set of functions: all in the "gui" module.

You create a GUI Script File in your project and attach it to the GUI component by selecting the root GUI component in the outline view and then choosing a script file in the properties view.

image::images/gui/gui_script.png["Script", align="center"]

The script file is by default equipped with functions just as game object scripts:

----
function init(self)
function final(self)
function update(self, dt)
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
function on_reload(self)
----

GUI components can thus receive input and messages just as game objects. You send messages to a GUI component by addressing the component in the fragment part of the URL:

[source-code]
----
local msgdata = { score = 4711, stars = 3, health = 6 }                
msg.post("hud#gui", "set_stats", msgdata)
----

== Handling different resolutions and aspect ratios

GUI components are rendered separately and on top of other game content and there are some mechanisms in place to make life easier for game developers that target device that have screens of different resolutions and aspect ratios.

Your Defold game project specifies a target resolution in the "game project" settings, however one or more of your target devices might have a different screen resolution and aspect ratio. In this case this means that your game will be up- or downscaled to fit the target screen.

Defold deals with the scaling of any GUI components differently to other game content. It also provides you with a set of simple, but powerful tools to lay out your user interface independently of resolution and/or aspect ratio.

Let’s illustrate with a little experiment and create a game app with a GUI. The display size is set to a square with dimensions 1024x1024. The game contains a GUI component with a level menu on top of some imagery. This is how it looks when run on a computer:

image::images/gui/gui_square.png["Square", align="center"]

Now, if we run the same app on the iPad (with a very different screen size and aspect ratio of 4:3) we get the following result:

image::images/gui/gui_ipad.png["iPad square", align="center"]

We see that on the iPad the game is stretched out to fill the screen. The octopus in the background looks squished. But the GUI looks good. The text nodes are rendered with the correct aspect ratio and keeps their location in the center of the screen.

You can easily simulate changes to the screen resolution and aspect ratio by changing the window size of your running Defold game. Running the game on a device with a different resolution and aspect ratio is equivalent to changing the window. When the window changes size it triggers redrawing and re-positioning of GUI components according to a set of adjustment and anchoring rules that give you good control over your user interface layout.

=== Adjust mode

When the window is resized and the resolution and aspect ratio is changed, all nodes are reshaped and adjusted according to how their Adjust Mode property is set. This property can be either of the following three settings:

   . Fit. This is the default. The node is uniformly scaled proportionally against the resized window’s width or height, whichever is smallest.
   . Zoom. The node is uniformly scaled proportionally against the resized window’s width or height, whichever is largest.
   . Stretch. The node is reshaped proportionally against the resized window.

It’s perhaps easiest to understand the adjust modes by looking at the following example. We create a GUI component that is square. We attach a image-grid to a sprite and use it as background. In the GUI, we simply place a box node and size it so it matches the grid:

image::images/gui/gui_default_adjust.png["Adjust mode", align="center"]

So, the blue box is a box node and the grid is part of the game content (which will be stretched as we resize the window). Let’s see what happens to the box node when we resize the window:

image::images/gui/gui_adjust_fit.png["Adjust fit", align="center"]

The box has the default adjust mode "Fit" and is uniformly scaled proportionally against the window’s height, which is less than the window width.

Let’s now change the box adjust mode to "Zoom" and _hot reload_ (see the link:/doc/scripting[Scripting documentation] for details) the GUI into the running game:

image::images/gui/gui_adjust_zoom.png["Adjust zoom", align="center"]

With "Zoom" adjust mode, the box is uniformly scaled, but now proportionally to the width, which is higher than the height.

Finally, let’s change adjust mode to "Stretch" and reload:

image::images/gui/gui_adjust_stretch.png["Adjust stretch", align="center"]

With "Stretch" adjust mode, the node will be resized horizontally proportionally to the window width and vertically proportionally to the window height.

Text nodes behave in exactly the same way. The adjust mode applies to the invisible text bounding box that controls the shape of the text.

=== Anchors

Anchors control the behavior of a node’s position when the window is resized. New nodes are created _non anchored_ meaning that they are positioned relative to the center of the screen.

==== Node repositioning without anchors

The default behavior of a created node is the following

   * The GUI component’s coordinate system is uniformly scaled and centered inside the resized window.
   * The node keeps its position in this scaled coordinate system.

This means that all non-anchored nodes will keep their relative distance, in relation to the screen center. To illustrate, if the window gets wider, the added width (relatively) gets distributed equally on the sides of the GUI:

image::images/gui/gui_no_anchor_sizeup.png["No anchor size up", align="center"]

Similarly, if the window is shrunk and gets relatively narrower, the added height (relatively) is distributed equally above and below the GUI:

image::images/gui/gui_no_anchor_sizedown.png["No anchor size down", align="center"]

==== Node repositioning with anchors

By setting the Xanchor and/or the Yanchor properties you can lock the position of nodes relative to the edges of the window.

   * Xanchor set to "Left" will lock the horizontal position of the node against the left window edge.
   * Xanchor set to "Right" will lock the horizontal position of the node against the right window edge.
   * Yanchor set to "Top" will lock the vertical position of the node against the top window edge.
   * Yanchor set to "Bottom" will lock the vertical position of the node against the bottom window edge.

In practice this means that if you set the Xanchor property to "Right" and the Yanchor property to "Top", the node will keep its position relative to the top right corner of the GUI. The distance to the right edge and the top edge will be kept constant:

image::images/gui/gui_anchor_topright.png["Anchor top right", align="center"]

==== Pivot

Each node has a position, scale and rotation inside the GUI coordinate system. A node is placed on that position so that its pivot is at the set coordinate and any rotation is done around that same pivot.

The default positioning and rotation of nodes happen against the center of the node—it has the Pivot property set to "Center". You can change the pivot of a node to any of one of the following settings:

   * Center
   * North, South, East, West
   * North West, North East, South West, South East

The following image illustrates the position of each pivot setting:

image::images/gui/pivot_points.png["Pivot points", align="center"]

If you change the pivot of a node, the node will be moved so that the new pivot will be at the given position.

== GUI scripts

Since GUI nodes have no logic in themselves but are controlled by a GUI script attached to the GUI component, you have to get direct script control of the nodes. This is done by obtaining a node reference using the node’s id. The reference is usually stored in a variable and then used to manipulate the node:

[source-code]
----
-- Obtain a reference to the "magic" text node
local magicnode = gui.get_node("magic")
-- Change the color of the node to orange
local orange = vmath.vector4(1.0, 0.3, 0.0, 1.0)
gui.set_color(magicnode, orange)
----

As soon as you have obtained the reference to a node by the +gui.get_node()+ function you can call any of the many manipulation functions in the GUI module to reposition, resize, change appearance of, reorder in draw-order, or move in the parent-child hierarchy. All node properties are accessible through scripting.

=== Node id:s

Each node must have a unique id. If you create a box node, it will have a default id "box" and a text node has the id "text". You should change the id of each created node right away to a more descriptive, unique name. If the Defold GUI editor detects an id name collision, an error is signalled.

=== Dynamically created nodes

To create a new node with script in runtime you have two options. You either create the node from scratch:

[source-code]
----
-- Create a new, white box node at position 300, 300 with size 150x200
local new_position = vmath.vector3(300, 300, 0)
local new_size = vmath.vector3(150, 200, 0) 
local new_boxnode = gui.new_box_node(new_position, new_size)
-- Add a text node at the same position
local new_textnode = gui.new_text_node(new_position, "Hello!")
With the newly created nodes' references stored in variables you are now free to manipulate the nodes:
-- Rotate the text node 10 degrees (around the z-axis)
gui.set_rotation(new_textnode, vmath.vector3(0, 0, 10))
----

If we put this code in the GUI script’s init() function and run the game we get the following:

image::images/gui/gui_script_create_nodes.png["Script create node", align="center"]

The alternative way to create new nodes is to clone an existing node:

[source-code]
----
-- Clone the magic text node
local magicnode = gui.get_node("magic")
local magic2 = gui.clone(magicnode)
-- The new node is right on top of the original. Let's move it.
gui.set_position(magic2, vmath.vector3(300, 300, 0))
----

=== Dynamic node id:s

Dynamically created nodes do not get an id assigned to them. This is by design. The reference you get returned from +gui.new_box_node()+, +gui.new_text_node()+ and +gui.clone()+ is exactly what’s needed to be able to access the node and you should keep track of that reference.

[source-code]
----
-- Add a text node
local new_textnode = gui.new_text_node(vmath.vector3(100, 100, 0), "Hello!")
-- "new_textnode" contains the reference to the node.
-- The node has no id, and that is fine. There's no reason why we want
-- to do gui.get_node() when we already have the reference.
----

[[anchor-a]]
== Animation

Several of the node properties can be fully asynchronously animated. To animate a property, you use the +gui.animate()+ function and supply the following parameters:

----
gui.animate(node, property, to, easing, duration [,delay] [,complete_function] [,playback])
----

[NOTE]
See link:/ref/go#go.animate[go.animate()] for details on the parameters.

The "property" parameter is usually given as a constant (+gui.PROP_POSITION+ etc), but can also be supplied as described in the Properties guide (see link:doc/properties[Properties]). This is handy if you want to animate just a specific component of a compound property value.

For instance, the "color" property describes a, RGBA value, encoded in a vector4 value with one component for each color component red, green and blue, and the last one for alpha. The vector components are named respectively "x", "y", "z" and "w" and the alpha is thus in the "w" component.

To fade up and down the alpha value of a node we can do that with the following piece of code:

[source-code]
----
function fadeup(self, node)
        gui.animate(node, "color.w", 1.0, gui.EASING_LINEAR, 
0.3, 0, fadedown, gui.PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD)
end

function fadedown(self, node)
        gui.animate(node, "color.w", 0.0, gui.EASING_LINEAR, 
0.3, 0, fadeup, gui.PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD)
end
----

Now we can call either +fadeup()+ or +fadedown()+ and supply the node we want the alpha animated on. Note that we use the "complete_function" property to supply the function to call when the animation is done, effectively chaining an endless loop of fade up and fade downs.

== Render script

The default render script is a Lua script that renders GUI nodes on top of the rest of a game in a separate pass:

[source-code]
----
...
render.set_view(vmath.matrix4())
render.set_projection(vmath.matrix4_orthographic(0, 
render.get_window_width(), 0, 
render.get_window_height(), -1, 1))
render.draw(self.gui_pred)
render.draw(self.text_pred)
...
----

The view is a normal identity matrix and the projection is orthographic. You can create custom render scripts for your project by copying the "default.render_script" and "default.render" render file from the "builtins/render" folder, changing them as you wish and then specifying your custom renderer under the "bootstrap" section of the project settings (see link:doc/game_project[Project settings]).

To illustrate, we can tell render all GUI components with a 3D "camera" view and perspective projection:

[source-code]
----
-- Set up a view to get a 3D positioned camera.
local w = render.get_window_width() * 0.5
local h = render.get_window_height() * 0.5
local view = vmath.matrix4_look_at(vmath.vector3(w-25, h-10, 70),
vmath.vector3(w, h, -250),
vmath.vector3(0, 1.0, 0))
render.set_view(view)
-- Perspective projection
render.set_projection(vmath.matrix4_perspective(2.5, 4/3, 0.1, 1000))
    
render.draw(self.gui_pred)
render.draw(self.text_pred)
----

This now affects all GUI components that are rendered. Here’s a version of our previous level menu with the modified render-script:

image::images/gui/gui_renderscript.png["Render script", align="center"]
