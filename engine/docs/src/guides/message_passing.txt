Addressing and Message Passing
==============================

Addressing
----------

To address and reference different objects in Defold, we use a URL-like format.
There is also a URL type (link:/ref/msg#msg.url[msg.url]) which provides more ways of constructing URLs.

[source-code, lua]
----
-- Format:
"[socket:][path][#fragment]"
-- Examples:
"@physics:" -- physics system
"#sprite" -- sprite component
"player#script" -- script component of a player object
----

_Socket_ is the name of the socket (or "port") in the system, which can also be thought of as a domain of objects.
The path is unique and specifies an object inside that domain.
The fragment is also unique and specifies a sub object inside the object specified by the path.

When communicating with game objects, the socket is the name of the root collection they belong to.
The path specifies the game object and is a a slash-segmented path of the collection names leading up to the game object id.
When specifying the path in a script, the path can be relative the game object containing the script or global by including a leading slash.
The fragment specifies the component.

There are two short-hand URL forms for convenience:

* +"."+ results in a URL to the game object containing the script
* +"#"+ results in a URL to the script

When communicating with other parts of the engine, only the socket is used.
These are the URLs of different systems in Defold:

* +"@physics:"+
* +"@render:"+
* +"@system:"+

Message Passing
---------------

Much of the communication between systems and game objects in Defold is based on link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing[message passing].
It provides separation and less dependencies between systems, while still allowing anything to communicate with anything.

When posting a message, three things are needed:

* The address (URL) of the recipient
* The message id
* The data to be passed along with the message (some messages don't have additional data attached)

There are two types of messages, predefined messages in Defold (which you can find in the link:/ref/engine[reference]) and user defined messages.
Predefined messages must contain specific data and can only be sent to specific components or systems (this is detailed in the reference documentation).
User defined messages can only be sent to other scripts.
In this case you pick whatever data you want to pass along.

Posting a message from a script is very simple:

[source-code, lua]
----
-- post to the script of another game object
msg.post("my_go#script", "my_message", {my_parameter = "my_value"})
-- post to the system socket to exit the game
msg.post("@system:", "exit", {code = 0})
----

Example
-------

This example demonstrates some of the parts described above.
Suppose that you have a moving cannon which the player can enter and fire by input.
Then you could have the following structure inside your main collection:

* main [Collection]
** player [Game Object]
*** script [Script Component: player.script]
** cannon [Collection]
*** controller [Game Object]
**** script [Script Component: controller.script]
**** bullet_factory [Factory Component]
*** seat [Game Object]
**** barrel [Game Object]
***** muzzle [Game Object]

Some parts (like graphics) have been left out for clarity.

In player.script:

[source-code, lua]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
    if action_id == hash("enter") then
        -- set the cannon-seat as a parent to the player so the player follows the movement of the cannon
        -- the "." is a short-hand for the containing game object (player in this case)
        msg.post(".", "set_parent", {parent_id = go.get_id("cannon/seat"), keep_world_transform = 0})
        -- set player position to origo:
        go.set_position(vmath.vector3())
        self.inside_cannon = true
    elseif action_id == hash("exit") then
        -- unparent the player from the seat to detach
        msg.post(".", "set_parent", {parent_id = nil, keep_world_transform = 1})
        self.inside_cannon = false
    elseif action_id == hash("fire") then
        if self.inside_cannon then
            -- fire the cannon
            msg.post("fire", "cannon/controller#script")
        end
    elseif action_id == hash("aim_up") then
        if self.inside_cannon then
            msg.post("aim_up", "cannon/controller#script")
        end
    elseif action_id == hash("aim_down") then
        if self.inside_cannon then
            msg.post("aim_down", "cannon/controller#script")
        end
    end
end
----

In controller.script:

[source-code, lua]
----
go.property("max_aim", 90)
go.property("min_aim", 0)
go.property("aim_delta", 2)

function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
    if message_id == hash("fire") then
        -- fire the cannon by spawning bullets at the muzzle, relative path
        local p = go.get_world_position("muzzle")
        local r = go.get_world_rotation("barrel")
        factory.create("#bullet_factory", p, r, {speed = 200})
        -- update timers for fire-rate, play sounds etc
    elseif message_id == hash("aim_up") then
        -- aim by rotating barrel up
        local v = go.get("barrel", "euler.z")
        v = v + self.aim_delta
        if v > self.max_aim then
            v = self.max_aim
        end
        go.set("barrel", "euler.z", v)
    elseif message_id == hash("aim_down") then
        -- aim by rotating barrel down
        local v = go.get("barrel", "euler.z")
        v = v - aim_delta
        if v < self.min_aim then
            v = self.min_aim
        end
        go.set("barrel", "euler.z", v)
    end
end
