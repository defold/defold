Defold Input Guide
==================

This guide handles binding hardware input devices to your game and reacting to them in scripts.

Binding Inputs
--------------

In Defold, you bind hardware inputs to game specific logical actions.
A typical example is to bind the *Space bar* to the logical action +jump+.
By separating the hardware input from the logical actions, you can script using the actions relevant to your game, without having to take the hardware into consideration.
If you decide later on that you want to change which hardware inputs trigger what actions, there is only one place to modify.

The bindings are specified in an _Input Binding_ file (.input_binding).
By default, the engine will look for the file +/input/game.input_binding+ in your project, but you can change this in the link:/doc/game_project[game.project] file.

The file contains different hardware triggers for keyboard, mouse, touches and gamepads (Sixaxis/XBox 360).
Please check the link:/ref/go#on_input[reference documentation] for how to handle each input.
For convenience, single touch is currently converted into a mouse input to easier test your game.

[IMPORTANT]
On Windows, only XBox 360 controllers are currently supported.
To hook up your 360 controller to your Windows machine, make sure it is link:http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Xbox-360-Controller-for-Windows[setup] correctly.

You can add and remove triggers via the context menus of the different trigger types.

Handling Input
--------------

Input is only sent to game objects that have acquired it.
To acquire input, you post the message link:/ref/go#acquire_input_focus[+acquire_input_focus+] to the game object itself.
This is usually done in the link:/ref/go#init[init-callback] of the script:

[source-code, lua]
----
function init(self)
    msg.post(nil, "acquire_input_focus")
end
----

Once you have done that, the script will start receiving input in its link:/ref/go#on_input[on_input-callback].
You can handle input like this in both link:/doc/scripting_debugging[gui- and logic scripts].

Here is an example of such a function, handling the action +jump+ mentioned above.
Remember that you can give the action any name which has some meaning in your game.

[source-code, lua]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
    if action_id == hash("jump") and action.pressed then
        -- start_jump(self) is defined elsewhere
        start_jump(self)
    end
end
----

The +action+-parameter contains relevant information, like if the input was +pressed+ or +released+, and where the mouse was at the time (+x+,+y+ when available).
See the link:/ref/go#on_input[reference] for details.

Prioritizing Input
------------------

When you acquire input focus for a game object, that game object is placed at the top of a line of game objects who had requested input before.
In Defold we call this line the _input stack_.
This means that whoever had input before is remembered.
If you release input focus from a game object, it's removed from the stack and input will be passed on to the others.
You do this by posting the message link:/ref/go#release_input_focus[+release_input_focus+] to the game object:

[source-code, lua]
----
msg.post(nil, "release_input_focus")
----

In the on_input-callback you have a choice of whether to consume the input or pass it on to the others.
If you return +true+, the input is consumed and not passed on to the others.
If you return +false+ (or nothing), the input is passed on.

Example
~~~~~~~

This is an example of a game situation where this would be useful, since it has conflicting inputs.
In this game, the player can move right and left.
By pushing up and down, the player can jump and dodge.
Now we want to add the ability to talk to NPCs by selecting phrases from a list.
The phrases are also selected by pushing up and down, which normally means jump/dodge.

You could then have a separate game object that controls the dialogue and temporarily acquires input while the player is close enough.
It would then consume input for selecting phrases, to keep the player from jumping or dodging.
For other input, it could pass it on to let the player leave the NPC by moving at any time.
The on_input callback in the dialogue script could look like this:

[source-code, lua]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
    if action_id == hash("up") then
        select_prev_phrase()
        --consume
        return true
    elseif action_id == hash("down") then
        select_next_phrase()
        --consume
        return true
    end
    -- pass on
    return false
end
----

Passing Input to Collection Proxies
-----------------------------------

[IMPORTANT]
This section describes how to pass input to collections which have been dynamically loaded using collection proxies.
They have unfortunately not been documented yet.
There is a forum thread describing them a bit more link:http://defold.userecho.com/topic/112648-how-do-i-unload-load-collections/[here].

There is an important detail concerning collections loaded through collection proxies.
The game object containing the collection proxy needs to acquire input for the input to be passed into the loaded collection.
Then some game object in that collection needs to acquire it too.
We are not completely sure about this design, since it makes things a bit cumbersome.
We are looking into ways to simplify it, like considering the input stack to be global instead of per-collection.
