Input
=====

Defold listens to input from a variety of devices and allows you to write script logic that matches your design. The input device types that Defold supports are:

1. Keyboard
2. Mouse (including mouse wheel actions)
3. Multitouch (on iOS and Android devices)
4. Gamepads (as supported through the operating system)

[IMPORTANT]
====
On Windows, only XBox 360 controllers are currently supported. To hook up your 360 controller to your Windows machine, make sure it is setup correctly. See http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Xbox-360-Controller-for-Windows
====

All user input is captured by the engine and dispatched as actions to script- and GUI script components in game objects that has acquired input focus and that implements the +on_input()+ function.

Before the input reaches your script it is translated through input bindings into meaningful actions:

image::images/input/input_bindings.png["Input bindings", align="center"]

Depending on the components that have acquired input focus, and whether they consume this input or pass it on, the input may or may not reach a specific component's +on_input()+. We will look at how this works in detail below.

== Input bindings

The input bindings is a project wide table that allows you to specify how raw input should translated into meaningful *actions* before they are dispatched to your Lua scripts. The input bindings is by default named "game.input_binding" and and is found in the "input" folder at the root of your project. You can, however, easily change its name and location and update the project settings so the engine will find the bindings (see link:http://doc.defold.com/doc/project-settings[Project settings]).

image::images/input/input_set_bindings.png["Input set bindings", align="center"]

There are five types of triggers that you can create. They are device specific:

1. +key_trigger+ and +text_trigger+ are for keyboard input
2. +mouse_trigger+ is for mouse input
3. +gamepad_trigger+ is for system gamepads (e.g. Xbox or Playstation controllers)
4. +touch_trigger+ is for all types of touch input

Right click on a trigger type and select "Add [type]_trigger..." to add a new trigger. Each trigger has two fields:

input :: A scroll list with the available inputs to listen to.
action :: The action name given to input actions when they are created and dispatched to your scripts.

For instance, to set up key bindings for movement left and right for a game, you might want to do something like this:

image::images/input/input_key_bindings.png["Input key bindings", align="center"]

Here, the inputs +KEY_LEFT+ (the left arrow key on the keyboard) and +KEY_RIGHT+ (the right arrow key) are bound to the action names "move_left" and "move_right" respectively. The benefit of separating the hardware input from the logical actions is that if you decide later on that you want to change which hardware inputs trigger what actions, there is only one place to modify.

== Acquiring and releasing input focus

To listen to input actions, create a game object with a script (or GUI script) component. In the script, send the game object itself a message "acquire_input_focus":

[source-code]
----
function init(self)
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
end
----

This message instructs Defold to direct input actions to the current game object. Technically, what happens is that the object is added to an *input stack* (see below for further details).
To stop listening to input actions, simply send a "release_input_focus" message to the game object:

[source-code]
----
...
msg.post(".", "release_input_focus")
...
----

== on_input()

To react on input actions, you need a component in your game object (that has acquired input focus) with a script and an +on_input()+ function. The engine will then dispatch input actions to the function.

[source-code]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
----

The function takes 2 parameters (besides "self"):

+action_id+ :: The name of the message, as set up in the input bindings. The name is hashed.
+action+ :: A Lua table containing the message data.

To (very crudely) handle the "move_left" and "move_right" bindings we set up above, we can write the following code:

[source-code]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
        if action_id == hash("move_left") and action.pressed then
                local pos = go.get_position()
                pos.x = pos.x - 100
                go.set_position(pos)
        elseif action_id == hash("move_right") and action.pressed then
                local pos = go.get_position()
                pos.x = pos.x + 100
                go.set_position(pos)
        end
end
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When working with collection proxies it is imperative to understand how input is dispatched through collections. If you can't get input to work with your collection proxies, make sure to read <<anchor-iacp, Input and Collection Proxies>> below.
====

=== Action fields

The +action+ parameter sent to +on_input()+ for each input message is a Lua table containing useful data like the value of the input, the position of the input, whether button input was "pressed", "repeated" or "released".

[NOTE]
====
See link:ref/go#on_input[on_input()] for details on the available action fields.

====

=== Screen positions

Mouse and touch input set fields in the +action+ table for location (+x+ and +y+) as well as movement (+dx+ and +dy+). These inputs also set specific fields that are calculated against the real screen space. These fields are called:

+screen_x+ and +screen_y+ :: The real screen position
+screen_dx+ and +screen_dy+ :: The real screen delta change since last update

These fields are useful on devices where the screen pixel position differs from the game position--for instance if you run a lower resolution game on a retina screen that scales the game. For instance, on the iPad you can have a screen that is 1024x768 but each "logical" pixels consists of 4 real ones and maps to a physical resolution of 2048x1536.

=== Key triggers

Key triggers are simple one-key inputs that acts as button input. They are useful for games that needs to tie specific buttons to specific functions, like the "move_left" and "move_right" button setup above. If you need to read arbitrary key input, use text triggers (see below).

=== Multi touch triggers

Multi touch triggers populate a subtable in the action table called +action.touch+. The elements in the table are numbered 1-N (where N is the number of touch points) and each element contains fields with input data.

[NOTE]
====
See link:ref/go#on_input[on_input()] for details on the available touch action fields.
====

Since the elements are in a numbered table, array-like, you can traverse it easily:

[source-code]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
        if action_id == hash("touch") and #action.touch > 1 and #action.touch < 4 then
                -- If there's 2-3 touch point we'll spawn
                -- magic spark particles at each point.
                for i, tpoint in ipairs(action.touch) do
                        local pos = vmath.vector3(tpoint.x, tpoint.y, 0)
                        factory.create("#factory", pos)
                end
        end
end
----

Here, a component "factory" is used to spawn a simple particle effect with +factory.create()+. The result is a nice trail of spawned particles for each finger as you touch the device screen using 2 or 3 fingers.

image::images/input/input_multitouch.png["Input multitouch", align="center"]

=== Mouse triggers

Mouse triggers come in two forms. The first one is mouse button and wheel input that you set up in your input bindings.

[NOTE]
====
The inputs MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT, MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT and MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE are equivalent to MOUSE_BUTTON_1, MOUSE_BUTTON_2 and MOUSE_BUTTON_3.
====

The second form of mouse trigger is mouse movement input. Mouse movements cannot be bound in the input bindings, and does not set the +action_id+ to a name. Instead, the +action_id+ is set to +nil+ and the action table is populated with the location and delta movement of the mouse position.

=== Gamepad triggers

The gamepad triggers allows you to bind standard gamepad input to game functions. Defold supports gamepads through the host operating system and offers bindings for:

1. Left and right sticks (direction and clicks)
2. Left and right digital pads
3. Left and right triggers
4. Left and right shoulder buttons
5. Start, Back and Guide buttons

[NOTE]
====
Right pad usually translates to the A, B, X and Y buttons on the Xbox controller and square, circle, triangle and cross buttons on the Playstation controller.
====

=== Text trigger

Text triggers allows you to read arbitrary text input. A text trigger sets the "text" field of the action table to a string containing the typed character. The action is only fired at the press of the button, no "release" or "repeated" action is sent.

[source-code]
----
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
        if action_id == hash("text") then
                -- Concatenate the input character to the "text" node...
                local node = gui.get_node("text")
                local text = gui.get_text(node)
                text = text .. action.text
                gui.set_text(node, text)
        end
end
----

== The input stack

Any game object that acquires input focus is put first in the list of objects that listens to input. This list is called the *input stack*. Input actions are dispatched to the top object's components first and actions then trickles further down the stack to other components that listens to input:

image::images/input/input_stack.png["Input stack", align="center"]

Dispatch of actions happen within the same frame so unless you deliberately control the dispatch of actions down the stack (see "Consuming input" below) it will appear as if all listening components' +on_input()+ functions will receive actions simultaneously.

=== Stack order

If you have a set of game objects that all acquire input, they get added to the top of the input stack one by one:

[source-code]
----
-- in "listener1.script"
function init(self)
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
end

-- in "listener2.script"
function init(self)
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
end
----

Initialization and update order between objects is, however, unknown. So there is no guarantee that the listeners will appear on the stack in any specific order.

In situations where you need the listeners on the stack in a particular order you can force a specific input order between objects by chaining a series of messages:

[source-code]
----
-- in "listener1.script"
function init(self)
        -- We're added to the input stack first, "listener2" second.
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
        msg.post("listener2", "acquire_input")
end

-- in "listener2.scrip"
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
        if message_id == hash("acquire_input") then
                -- Acquire input when we get this message.
                msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
        end
end
----

Running this code will result in an input stack ordered like this:

image::images/input/input_stack_order.png["Input stack order", align="center"]

=== Consuming input

A component's +on_input()+ code can actively control whether actions should be passed on down the stack or not:

1. If the component +on_input()+ code returns +false+, or if there is no return statement in the code (an omitted return statement implies a +nil+ return which is a false value in Lua) input actions will be passed on to the next game object on the input stack.
2. If any of a game object components' scripts return +true+ in its +on_input()+ then the input is consumed and not passed on to other objects further down the input stack.

[NOTE]
====
A game object can contain several script components. All input actions are broadcast to the game object's components.

A game object that lacks an +on_input()+ function will pass on input actions down the stack just as if it had returned +false+ in an +on_input()+  function.
====

image::images/input/input_stack_consume.png["Consuming input", align="center"]

There are several good use cases where input consumption provides a simple and powerful way to shift input between different parts of a game. For example, if you need a pop-up menu that temporarily is the only part of the game that listens to input.

Let's say that you are building a game where you control a wizard through touch input. In the corner, you put a HUD menu item that allows the player to pause the game.

image::images/input/input_pause_menu_1.png["Input pause menu", align="center"]

The pause menu is initially hidden (disabled) and when the player touches the "PAUSE" HUD item, it is enabled:

[source-code]
----
function init(self)
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
end

function on_input(self, action_id, action)
        if action_id == hash("mouse_press") and action.pressed then
                local x = action.x
                local y = action.y
                -- Get the "pause" node and see if player has pressed it.
                local pausenode = gui.get_node("pause")
                if gui.pick_node(pausenode, x, y) then
                        -- Tell the pause menu to take over.
                        msg.post("pause_menu", "show")
                end
        end
end
----

image::images/input/input_pause_menu_2.png["Input pause menu", align="center"]

The pause menu consists of a coloured background containing a set of child menu items. By disabling and enabling the "background" node, the whole pause menu GUI can be shown and hidden:

image::images/input/input_pause_GUI.png["Input pause GUI", align="center"]

The pause menu GUI runs the following code:

[source-code]
----
function init(self)
        -- Fetch background node and disable.
        -- Everything is childed under it.
        local node = gui.get_node("background")
        gui.set_enabled(node, false)
end

function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
        if message_id == hash("show") then
                -- First, show the pause menu.
                local node = gui.get_node("background")
                gui.set_enabled(node, true)

                -- Now, acquire input. We're gonna be on top of
                -- the input stack. Yay!
                msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
        end
end

function on_input(self, action_id, action)
        if action_id == hash("mouse_press") and action.pressed then
                local x = action.x
                local y = action.y
                -- Get the nodes and see if we have pressed any.
                local loadnode = gui.get_node("load")
                local savenode = gui.get_node("save")
                local resumenode = gui.get_node("resume")
                if gui.pick_node(loadnode, x, y) then
                        print("THE GAME WILL LOAD...")
                elseif gui.pick_node(savenode, x, y) then
                        print("THE GAME WILL SAVE...")
                elseif gui.pick_node(resumenode, x, y) then
                        -- Resume the game...
                        -- First, hide the pause menu.
                        local node = gui.get_node("background")
                        gui.set_enabled(node, false)

                        -- Finally, release input.
                        msg.post(".", "release_input_focus")
                end
        end

        -- As long as we're listening to input, we're gonna consume it.
        -- This disables game controls while the pause menu is showing.
        return true
end
----

The +on_input()+ function of the pause menu GUI script returns +true+ as long as the menu shows. This means that it will consume all input actions. The game is thus effectively paused from a user input perspective.

[[anchor-iacp]]
=== Input and Collection Proxies

The input stack is actually not global--there exist a separate local input stack for each collection. If you use collection proxies to structure your game it is imperative to understand how input is dispatched through collections.

When input actions are passed on down the current collection's input stack and reaches a game object that contain a collection proxy component that is enabled, those actions will continue down the input stack of the dynamically loaded collection before they continue down the main collection's stack. The following diagram clarifies the process:

image::images/input/input_stack_proxy.png["Input stack proxy", align="center"]

It is clear now that in order for any +on_input()+ component code in a dynamically loaded collection to receive input actions, the game object containing the collection proxy *must* be on the input stack.

Even if the collection proxy's game object contain no +on_input()+ code at all, it must still send a "acquire_input_focus" message to itself to be added on top of the input stack. Any game object inside the loaded collection must send "acquire_input_focus" to get added to the collection's input stack.


Note that if at any step down the input stack an +on_input()+ function returns true, then it will consume the input. It does not matter where that happens, actions will not be passed on further. If necessary, a loaded collection can therefore consume input and prevent objects further down the main collection input stack from receiving any actions.
