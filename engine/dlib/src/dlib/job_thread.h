/**
 * The job system is designed to be able to do jobs asynchronously, if threads are available, but also support single threaded systems.
 * Each job implements a "process" function, and an optional "callback" function.
 * - The process function is the one that should be doing the work.
 *   Note that for single threaded systems, this work is still done on the main thread.
 * - The callback function is always called on the main thread.
 *   This may be good if you need to sync with non-threaded systems like Lua
 *
 * - Jobs can have dependencies
 *   Each job can have a parent job.
 *   Setting a parent must be done before any of the jobs are pushed onto the queue.
 *   The parent job won't be run processed until all the children are processed.
