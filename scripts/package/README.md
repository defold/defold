# Packaging the SDK's

Most of the SDKs used by Defold have licenses that prevent third party redistribution. To efficiently work with the build servers and our build pipeline it is recommended to package the SDKs and serve them from a private URL, accessible by `build.py`. The URL is defined as `CDN_PACKAGES_URL` in `build.py` (or `DM_PACKAGES_URL` environment variable).

We provide a number of scripts to package the SDKs into a format expected by `build.py`. The basic principle when packaging an SDK is to "zip it up" and put it in a cloud storage that the build scripts can access later on. Some of the package scripts can be run on a single host, and yet package the SDK for another host. However, some scripts need to be run on a certain host (for instance various installers).

Usually, the folders can be packaged as-is, but it's generally preferable to remove redundant folders in order to minimize download and installation sizes.
(E.g. for the extender Docker container)

## Installation

This step is automated given the proper archives (sdk's) are available either locally or on a file server.
You can configure the path via a command line option:

	 ./scripts/build.py --package-path=<local_folder_or_url> install_sdk --platform=<platform>

or by specifying the `DM_PACKAGES_URL` environment variable.

As a result, all packages should be unpacked under the path `$DYNAMO_HOME/ext/SDKs`:

	./tmp/dynamo_home/ext/SDKs
	├── android-ndk-r25b
	└── android-sdk

## Android

### Prerequisites

To package the SDK, you need to run it on Linux/macOS/Windows.
The NDK can be packaged on any host for any host.

The Android `sdkmanager` tool requires Java 8 to run.
Version 9 or 10 _can_ work with some hacks, but 11 won't work at all (see sdk script for particular hack details)

### Packaging

#### Android NDK

Run the script (on any host):

	$ ./scripts/package/package_android_ndk.sh darwin
	$ ./scripts/package/package_android_ndk.sh linux
	$ ./scripts/package/package_android_ndk.sh windows

and it will output the package in:

```
	_tmpdir/darwin/android-ndk-r25b-darwin.tar.gz
	_tmpdir/linux/android-ndk-r25b-linux.tar.gz
	_tmpdir/windows/android-ndk-r25b-windows.tar.gz
```

#### Android SDK

*Since this step is running an actual installer, it is required to be run on the respective host platform.*

Run the script (hostsystem is any of darwin/linux/windows):

	$ ./scripts/package/package_android_sdk.sh <hostsystem>

and it will output a package (depending on hostsystem):

```
	_tmpdir/darwin/android-sdk-darwin-android-35.tar.gz
	_tmpdir/linux/android-sdk-linux-android-35.tar.gz
	_tmpdir/windows/android-sdk-windows-android-35.tar.gz
```

An alternative approach could be using GitHub Actions. See *Package Android SDKs* (`pack-android-sdks.yml`).  

#### Tools

Download and unpack this this:

	$ wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip
	$ unzip sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip

And repackage into a tar file:

	$ tar -czf android-sdk-tools-linux-3859397.tar.gz tools


## iOS + macOS

### Prerequisites

This script cannot download the sdk's by itself, but instead relies on the user having installed XCode on the local machine. Download and install Xcode from the App Store or https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_16.2/Xcode_16.2.xip. Make sure to use the version listed in [sdk.py](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/build_tools/sdk.py).

### Packaging

Run the script

	./scripts/package/package_xcode_and_sdks.sh

and it will output files in `local_sdks` (version depends on which is the current recommended version):

	./local_sdks/MacOSX15.2.sdk.tar.gz
	./local_sdks/XcodeDefault16.2.xctoolchain.darwin.tar.gz
	./local_sdks/iPhoneOS18.2.sdk.tar.gz
	./local_sdks/iPhoneSimulator18.2.sdk.tar.gz

## Windows

Run the script

	./scripts/package/package_win32_sdk.sh

## HTML5

The installation of the HTML5 compiler is done by calling the build function `install_ems`:

	$ ./scripts/build.py install_ems

## Linux

We use packages from [Clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) for the Ubuntu16.04 target.
Current version: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-13.0.0/clang+llvm-13.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz

Download this file and put it into your `./local_sdks` folder.
The package will then be extracted when you run the `./scripts/build.py install_sdk` command.
