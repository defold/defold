They're just different, which is expected for a single channel SDF implementation.\r\n\r\nThe font glyph can prewarm the glyph cache if you've deselected \"All Characters\" on your font, and specified a small subset of characters.\r\n\r\nAt runtime, you can also add/remove glyphs to the font dynamically by calling `font.add_glyphs()`/`font.remove_glyphs()`\r\n\r\nYou can read more about usage of runtime fonts in the [font documentation](https://defold.com/manuals/font/).",
