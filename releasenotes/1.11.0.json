Read the following information to understand how to migrate your projects.\r\n\r\n### \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f Action Needed (Breaking Change)\r\n\r\n#### What is `scale_along_z`?\r\n`scale_along_z` was a hidden option in `*.collection` files, set to `0` by default.  \r\nWhen set to `0`, scaling on objects and collections did **not** affect their z-position.  \r\n\r\nFor example, if your sprite has a position `x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.1`, and its GameObject has a scale `x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 2.0`:\r\n- With `scale_along_z = 0`, the transform of the sprite remains `x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.1`\r\n- With `scale_along_z = 1`, the transform becomes `x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.2`\r\n\r\n#### Why Was It Removed?\r\nThis was a legacy feature that introduced special-case logic and added complexity to the engine. While it had utility in some 2D projects, it was often a source of confusion in 3D projects. To unify 2D and 3D workflows, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to remove it, even though it\u2019s a breaking change.\r\n\r\n#### Who Needs to Take Action?\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with `scale_along_z`, or you never explicitly set it to `1`, **you need to update your project**. If your project consistently used `scale_along_z: 1` across all collections, **no action is required**.\r\n\r\n#### What Should Be Done in Lua Code?\r\nTo avoid unexpected behavior now that scaling affects Z-position:\r\n\r\n- Replace all usages of `go.set_scale(number|vector3)` with `go.set_scale_xy(number|vector3)`\r\n- When accessing the `scale` property via `go.get()`, `go.set()`, or `go.animate()`, use the `scale.xy` property instead\r\n\r\n#### What Should Be Done in Project Files?\r\nReview your GameObjects and Collections and check for use of the Z component in the `scale` property.  \r\nIf you find a non 1.0 Z scale in your project, investigate why it's there. In most of 2D cases, the Z scale should always be 1.0 because it doesn't affect anything. However, in some cases\u2014such as pseudo-3D effects, perspective cameras, particles, 3D models, etc. Z-scaling may be intentional. These situations require manual review.\r\n\r\nIf all children of such an object have `position.z == 0`, then behavior will not change.  \r\nBut if `position.z` is non-zero, then the scale will now affect it, and you'll need to decide case by case how to proceed based on your game\u2019s requirements.  \r\nFor example:\r\n- You might need to adjust object positions to compensate for `scale.z` now affecting the children's positions.\r\n- Or, set the parent object's `scale.z` to 1.0 and instead scale all children individually (adjusting positions accordingly).\r\n\r\nAutomatic migration is not possible due to the variety of use cases.  \r\nPlease review and adjust your project accordingly.  \r\n\r\nWe apologize for the inconvenience and hope that this change leads to a more consistent and understandable workflow for all users.",
