## Engine
__NEW__: ([#10547](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10547)) __'Added support of runtime creating and updating of textures array'__ by ekharkunov
Texture arrays can be created and updated in the runtime. Example how it can be done:
```lua
--- create new texture array
	local new_tex = resource.create_texture("/runtime/example_array.texturec", {
		type = graphics.TEXTURE_TYPE_2D_ARRAY,
		width = 512,
		height = 512,
		page_count = 5,
		format = graphics.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGB,
	})
--- update texture array slice
	local tex_path = "/bundle_resources/slice_02.png"
	local data = sys.load_resource(tex_path)
	local buf = image.load_buffer(data)
	resource.set_texture(new_tex, {
		type = graphics.TEXTURE_TYPE_2D_ARRAY,
		width = buf.width,
		height = buf.height,
		page = 1,
		format = graphics.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGB
	}, buf.buffer)
	go.set("#mesh", "texture0", new_tex)
```

Also `resource.get_texture_info()` returns additional field `page_count` with actual slice count. For regular 2D texture value is 1, for cube map is 6.

__NEW__: ([#10619](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10619)) __'Make it possible to set GUI resources using `gui.set()`'__ by AGulev
It is now possible to set Font or Texture resources for a GUI using the `gui.set()` function from the GUI component itself, provided that `msg.url()` is used as the first argument instead of a node.

```lua
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
   if message_id == hash("set_font") then
       gui.set(msg.url(), "fonts", message.font, {key = "my_font_name"})
       gui.set_font(gui.get_node("text"), "my_font_name")
   elseif message_id == hash("set_texture") then
       gui.set(msg.url(), "textures", message.texture, {key = "my_texture"})
       gui.set_texture(gui.get_node("box"), "my_texture")
       gui.play_flipbook(gui.get_node("box"), "logo_256")
   end
end
```

__NEW__: ([#10539](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/10539)) __'Wrong include reference for dmMemory'__ by selimanac
Include reference should be `<dmsdk/dlib/memory.h>` not `<dmsdk/dlib/dalloca.h>`
Doc: https://defold.com/ref/stable/dmMemory/

__NEW__: ([#10715](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10715)) __'Added support for hash userdata type keys in lua table (de)serialization.'__ by Gert-Jan
It is now possible to use `sys.save()` and `sys.load()` to save and load tables with hashes as keys. This allows for example to (de)serialize tables that are produced and used by collectionfactory. This change also means that `sys.serialize()` and `sys.deserialize()` can serialize and deserialize tables with hashes as keys.

__FIX__: ([#10592](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10592)) __'Default to no wasm simd on HTML5'__ by JCash
This fixes a regression from 1.10.0

__FIX__: ([#10589](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10589)) __'Copy resources from pods'__ by ekharkunov
Now all resources from Pods correctly packed into .ipa.

__FIX__: ([#10529](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10529)) __'Updating volume and panning handling for sound system'__ by thengel01
* Sound panning now configured to correctly pan stereo sound instances (basically treats them as 2 mono sources for panning).

  * *NOTE:* This fixes a (very old) bug where the mechanism removed ~3dB of the sounds. The fix will make the sound strength back to normal again. If this bug fix affects your game, you can lower the main `sound.gain` (default 1.0) in the `game.project` settings.

* Added logic that can support exponential gain (as in: 0.5 perceptually is "half volume"). This is useful for a nicer fade ins/outs.
  * The functionality is enabled by setting the `sound.use_linear_gain = 0` in `game.project`

__FIX__: ([#10626](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10626)) __'Faster atlas creation'__ by AGulev
Atlas creation is now twice as fast in `bob.jar` and about three times faster in the editor.

__FIX__: ([#10631](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10631)) __'Make sure that GUI components are sorted per world'__ by AGulev
Make sure that GUI components spawned in different worlds (in different collection proxies) are sorted separately, and that the later-spawned world is always rendered on top unless another behavior is specified using `gui.set_render_order()`.

__FIX__: ([#10653](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10653)) __'go.exist() will now throw a Lua error if referencing another collection'__ by britzl
Like all other functions in the go.* namespace the `go.exists(url)` function will now throw a Lua error if specifying a url referencing a game object from a different collection than the one from which `go.exists()` was called.

__FIX__: ([#10656](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10656)) __'Fixes memory leak in profiler on web platforms'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#10661](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10661)) __'Make sure that changes in shaders are always taken into account during rebuild'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#10663](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10663)) __'Added function dmGameSys::ResFontSetLineHeight() to set font line height for dynamic fonts'__ by JCash

__FIX__: ([#10678](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10678)) __'Added mutex to font.cpp to protect when adding and removing glyphs dynamically'__ by JCash


__FIX__: ([#10695](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10695)) __'Updated to lipo 0.10 (4c7c275) to fix a Windows renaming issue'__ by JCash
https://github.com/konoui/lipo/releases/tag/v0.10.0

__FIX__: ([#10713](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10713)) __'Fixed issue where build to remote target can't load a file more than once'__ by AGulev
Fixed issue where cached resources loaded remotely from the editor return the wrong file size, resulting in a `string length overflow` error

__FIX__: ([#10654](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10654)) __'Make sure hashes are comparable even after the game object is removed'__ by AGulev
Fixes an issue where, after removing a game object, its ID isn't equal to a hash with the same value.

__FIX__: ([#10686](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10686)) __'Fixed data size when uploads compressed paged texture'__ by ekharkunov
Fixed wrong data size used when updating a compressed paged texture in OpenGL.

__FIX__: ([#10712](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10712)) __'Fixing EOS behavior of tremolo decoder when skipping data'__ by thengel01
This fixes a recently introduced issue with sound instances "hanging around" forever if they are played back with group volume down to zero.

__FIX__: ([#10705](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10705)) __'Adding check to avoid zero delta values in sound mixer'__ by thengel01
This change fixes a recently introduced issue where the engine would crash if a sound was played with a very low speed.

__FIX__: ([#10727](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10727)) __'Fix for getting win32 user directories containing unicode characters'__ by JCash
This fixes an issue where the engine wouldn't start for some users, when their app directory contained unicode characters.

__FIX__: ([#10730](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10730)) __'Improve `hash` management when creating objects using collectionfactory'__ by AGulev
Fix issue where `hash` can be removed while it's in use

__FIX__: ([#10734](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10734)) __'Remove all dynamically created hashes (from factories) when they aren't used anymore'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#10624](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10624)) __'Update `camera.set_orthographic_zoom` to accept numeric zoom value'__ by aglitchman
The function `camera.set_orthographic_zoom()` now accepts the value as number (before it was boolean) and works the same as setting this value via go.set.

__FIX__: ([#10758](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10758)) __'Remove logic that clenup archive from `*.fp` and `*.vp` files '__ by AGulev
There is no reason to check all the files and remove specifically `*.fp` and `*.vp` files from the files which end up in bundle. We don't add any `*.fp` or `*.vp` files into outputs

__FIX__: ([#10575](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10575)) __'Added thread support to HTML5'__ by JCash
This introduces a new web target platform `wasm_pthread-web`
When bundling, you can select to include supoprt for this platform.
Note that distribution sites using ADS don't generally support threads, as it requires CORS setup.

We've also updated to Emscripten 4.0.6.
This also updates our minimum supported browser versions:

No Threads:
* MIN_FIREFOX_VERSION=40
* MIN_SAFARI_VERSION=101000
* MIN_CHROME_VERSION=45

With pthreads:
* MIN_FIREFOX_VERSION=79
* MIN_SAFARI_VERSION=150000
* MIN_CHROME_VERSION=75

__FIX__: ([#10764](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10764)) __'Fix for OpenGL backend using non async mode'__ by JCash


__FIX__: ([#10766](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10766)) __'HTML5: Rebuilt Box2d v2 and Glfw 2.7 without Wasm Simd support'__ by JCash
This fixes a regression from 1.10.1.

###

__FIX__: ([#10769](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10769)) __'Fixed crash on Android when rebooting the engine'__ by AGulev
Fixed issue where `sys.reboot()` of the engine on Android may crash the game.

__FIX__: ([#10789](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10789)) __'Fixed issue with font cache invalidation'__ by AGulev
Fixed issue where the cache stayed invalidated after updating to a newer version of Defold where the font or glyph bank output format was changed.  
Usually, it appeared as a `Unable to create resource: /_generated_font_f8188ecab1e82fcc.glyph_bankc: FORMAT_ERROR` and could only be fixed by removing the `build` folder, which is no longer necessary.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#10587](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10587)) __'Allow getting/setting more properties using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Previously, some properties couldn't be get/set by editor scripts. Now, it's possible to do so! We added support for getting and setting:
- Color properties
- Multiline text properties
- Choice box properties 
- Slider properties

Remaining unsettable properties are curve and curve spread (in particle fx).

__NEW__: ([#10635](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10635)) __'Improve Scene View error experience'__ by matgis
* Render errors from Scene View objects are now presented in a more readable view and can be copied into the clipboard.
* Most shader syntax errors will now cause render errors in the Scene View.

__NEW__: ([#10651](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10651)) __'Directories are now treated as resources in editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now, directories may be accessed as resources in editor scripts. The directories have 2 properties:
- `path` - the path to the directory, same as with file resources
- `children` - list of children resources

For example, here is how you can ensure that an atlas has all images from a directory:
```lua
local images = editor.get("/assets/images", "children")
local atlas = "/assets/main.atlas"
local txs = {editor.tx.clear(atlas, "images")}
for i = 1, #images do
    local resource_path = editor.get(images[i], "path")
    if resource_path:match(".png$") ~= nil then
        txs[#txs + 1] = editor.tx.add(atlas, "images", {image = resource_path})
    end
end
editor.transact(txs)
```

__NEW__: ([#10644](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10644)) __'Allow editing atlas images and animations from scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now, it's possible to edit (add/remove) atlas images and animations using editor scripts. This is achieved using the following additions to the editor script API:
- atlas resources now define `images` and `animations` properties, which are lists of image and animation nodes, respectively
- atlas animations now define an `images` property, which is a list of image nodes
- `editor.get` can be used to get the list of images and animations in an atlas, and then to look up the properties of the returned nodes
- new transaction functions `editor.tx.add`, `editor.tx.remove`, and `editor.tx.clear` can be used to edit these node lists
- `editor.can_add` can be used to check if a node property is a list of nodes

Some examples:
1. Add an image to an atlas:
   ```lua
   editor.transact({
       editor.tx.add("/main.atlas", "images", {image="/assets/hero.png"})
   })
   ```
2. Find a set of all images used in an atlas:
   ```lua
   local all_images = {} ---@type table<string, true>
   -- first, collect all "bare" images
   local image_nodes = editor.get("/main.atlas", "images")
   for i = 1, #image_nodes do
       all_images[editor.get(image_nodes[i], "image")] = true
   end
   -- second, collect all images used in animations
   local animation_nodes = editor.get("/main.atlas", "animations")
   for i = 1, #animation_nodes do
       local animation_image_nodes = editor.get(animation_nodes[i], "images")
       for j = 1, #animation_image_nodes do
           all_images[editor.get(animation_image_nodes[j], "image")] = true
       end
   end
   pprint(all_images)
   -- {
   --     ["/assets/hero.png"] = true,
   --     ["/assets/enemy.png"] = true,
   -- }}
   ```
3. Replace all animations in an atlas:
   ```lua
   editor.transact({
       editor.tx.clear("/main.atlas", "animations"),
       editor.tx.add("/main.atlas", "animations", {
           id = "hero_run",
           images = {
               {image = "/assets/hero_run_1.png"},
               {image = "/assets/hero_run_2.png"},
               {image = "/assets/hero_run_3.png"},
               {image = "/assets/hero_run_4.png"}
           }
       })
   })
   ```

__NEW__: ([#10701](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10701)) __'Introduce property drag handle'__ by sprocketc
![drag-handle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36dd616-acf9-4ddf-baee-5f471475662f)
Draggable properties now display a dedicated drag controller on mouse over input, instead of using the label as a handle.

__NEW__: ([#10662](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10662)) __'Expose tilesource animations and collision groups to editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now editor scripts can access and edit animations and collision groups of tilesources using these 3 new tilesource properties:
- `animations` - a list of animation nodes of the tilesource
- `collision_groups` - a list of collision group nodes of the tilesource
- `tile_collision_groups` - a table of collision group assignments for tiles in the tilesource

For example, here is how you can setup a tilesource:
```lua
local tilesource = "/game/world.tilesource"
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add(tilesource, "animations", {id = "idle", start_tile = 1, end_tile = 1}),
    editor.tx.add(tilesource, "animations", {id = "walk", start_tile = 2, end_tile = 6, fps = 10}),
    editor.tx.add(tilesource, "collision_groups", {id = "player"}),
    editor.tx.add(tilesource, "collision_groups", {id = "obstacle"}),
    editor.tx.set(tilesource, "tile_collision_groups", {
        [1] = "player",
        [7] = "obstacle",
        [8] = "obstacle"
    })
})
```

__NEW__: ([#10714](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10714)) __'Edit tilemaps using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now you can edit tilemaps using editor scripts! To support this feature, we introduce the following additions to the editor script API:
- `editor.get(tilemap_layer, "tiles")` to get tiles from a tilemap layer
- `editor.tx.set(tilemap_layer, "tiles", tiles)` to create a transaction step that sets tiles in a tilemap layer
- `tilemap.tiles.new()` to create a fresh data structure that holds an unbounded 2d tile grid (in the editor, contrary to the engine, the tilemap is unbounded, and coordinates may be negative)
- `tilemap.tiles.get_tile(tiles, x, y)` to get a tile index at a specific coordinate
- `tilemap.tiles.get_info(tiles, x, y)` to get full tile information at a specific coordinate (the data shape is the same as in the engine's `tilemap.get_tile_info` function)
- `tilemap.tiles.iterator(tiles)` to create an iterator over all tiles in the tilemap
- `tilemap.tiles.clear(tiles)` to remove all tiles from the tilemap
- `tilemap.tiles.set(tiles, x, y, tile_or_info)` to set a tile at a specific coordinate
- `tilemap.tiles.remove(tiles, x, y)` to remove a tile at a specific coordinate

For example, here is how you can print the contents of the whole tilemap:
```lua
local layers = editor.get("/level.tilemap", "layers")
for i = 1, #layers do
    local layer = layers[i]
    local id = editor.get(layer, "id")
    local tiles = editor.get(layer, "tiles")
    print("layer " .. id .. ": {")
    for x, y, tile in tilemap.tiles.iterator(tiles) do
        print("  [" .. x .. ", " .. y .. "] = " .. tile)
    end
    print("}")
end
```

Here is how you can add a layer with tiles to a tilemap:
```lua
local tiles = tilemap.tiles.new()
tilemap.tiles.set(tiles, 1, 1, 2)
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/level.tilemap", "layers", {
        id = "new_layer",
        tiles = tiles
    })
})
```

- `"emitters"` and `"modifiers"` properties on particlefx component
- `"modifiers"` property on particlefx emitter component
- ability to read and write particlefx curve properties in editor scripts

New `emitters` and `modifiers` properties are node lists, where each node may be accessed using `editor.get()` and modified using `editor.tx.set()`. For example, adding a new circle emitter works like this:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/fire.particlefx", "emitters", {
        type = "emitter-type-circle"
    })
})
```

Curves are represented as a table with a non-empty list of `points`, where each point is a table with the following properties:
- `x` - the x coordinate of the point, should start at 0 and end at 1
- `y` - the value of the point
- `tx` (0 to 1) and `ty` (-1 to 1) - tangents of the point. E.g., for an 80-degree angle, `tx` should be `math.cos(math.rad(80))` and `ty` should be `math.sin(math.rad(80))`.
Curve spreads additionally have a `spread` number property.

For example, setting a particle lifetime alpha curve might look like this:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.set(emitter, "particle_key_alpha", { points = {
        {x = 0,   y = 0, tx = 0.1, ty = 1}, -- start at 0, go up quickly
        {x = 0.2, y = 1, tx = 1,   ty = 0}, -- reach 1 at 20% of a lifetime
        {x = 1,   y = 0, tx = 1,   ty = 0}  -- slowly go down to 0
    }})
})
```

__FIX__: ([#10610](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10610)) __'Donâ€™t apply Model material assignments unless fully-formed'__ by matgis
The editor will no longer try to apply Model material assignments that do not refer to a `.material` resource when rendering Models in the Scene View. This fixes an issue where manually deleting the path from the material resource field of a previously assigned material, that is no longer defined in the referenced Mesh, would cause an exception that locked up the editor.

__FIX__: ([#10696](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10696)) __'Take page offset into account when calculating the absolute position of the pivot handle'__ by sprocketc
Fixed pivot point handle position on paged atlases.

__FIX__: ([#10697](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10697)) __'Improve performance when editing a large tilesource'__ by sprocketc
Editing collision groups or other properties of a tilesource which do not affect the tilesource layout will no longer regenerate the texture.

__FIX__: ([#10685](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10685)) __'Fixed an issue with editor logs'__ by AGulev
Fixes the issue where logs in the Editor's console don't work when Simulated Resolution is used (Windows only).
