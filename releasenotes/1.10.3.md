## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#10765](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10776)) __'Fix crashes in `sys.load()` when trying to load corrupt files'__ by britzl
When using `sys.load()` to read from a corrupt file or from a file which wasn't created using `sys.save()` the engine would treat the file as using the legacy save file format from more than 11 years ago. This fallback to loading legacy format files would actually mostly result in engine crashes on corrupt files and cause more problems than it solved. The engine will now ignore such files and throw a Lua error.

__NEW__: ([#10598](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10794)) __'Make sure the viewport is scaled to fill the device display'__ by britzl
Added `viewport-fit=cover` to the `viewport` meta tag in index.html for web builds. This setting will make sure the viewport is scaled to fill the device display, even when the device has a camera notch or similar.

⚠️ Keep in mind that not all device displays are rectangular. A display may have a notch, hole or rounded corners. Ensure that important content doesn’t end up outside the display.

__NEW__: ([#10472](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10823)) __'The textures that were set using `go.set()/gui.set()` for the GUI component are internally used as dynamic textures.'__ by AGulev
Now, all the textures that were set to a `GUI` component from outside are internally considered dynamic GUI textures in the engine.

⚠️ Pay attention: if you set textures into the GUI this way, you may need to increase `Max Dynamic Textures` (default is 128) in the GUI component.

__NEW__: ([#7220](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10784)) __'Added IsURL(), ToURL(), PushURL() and 2 variants of CheckURL() to dmsdk.'__ by Gert-Jan
Allows native extensions to have better control over URLs in the lua state.

__FIX__: ([#10811](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10820)) __'Make the browser performance timeline optional and default it to off'__ by smagnuso
In game one can enable the performance timeline if desired

__FIX__: ([#10671](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10752)) __'Fix issue where profiler doesn't work after reboot'__ by AGulev
Make sure that the profiler shows the correct scope and property names after the engine reboot.

__FIX__: ([#10691,#10690](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10767)) __'Sanitize float values and escape strings for valid JSON output in scene graph dump'__ by deurell
Fix for non-finite floats and unescaped strings generating invalid JSON output in scene graph dumps.

__FIX__: ([#10174](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10586)) __'Removed modifier from RTRIGGER on Linux'__ by britzl
Tentative fix for broken RTRIGGER mapping on Linux since upgrade to GLFW3. Removed GAMEPAD_MODIFIER_NEGATE.

__FIX__: ([#10796](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10797)) __'Collision physics messages should be still sent when collision events are disabled in only one of the collision objects'__ by aglitchman
Fixed a bug where disabling `Generate Collision Events` or `Generate Contact Events` in a collision object could cause collision physics messages to stop being sent in 3D physics for objects where this was not disabled.

__FIX__: ([#10872](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10876)) __'Fix false positive physics overflow warning logs when physics.max_collision/physics.max_contacts are set to 0'__ by deurell
Fix false positive physics overflow warning logs when physics.max_collision/physics.max_contacts are set to 0

__FIX__: ([#10815](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10817)) __'Fix sys.get_sys_info() returning junk `system_version` on web platform'__ by aglitchman
The `sys.get_sys_info()` function may have returned junk in the `system_version` field for the web platform because it used an uninitialised structure as a source of data.

__FIX__: ([#7461](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10807)) __'Fixed Android debug symbols for vanilla engine'__ by ekharkunov
Fixed vanilla engine symbols downloading for Android. Added linker flag to generate build uuid for Android

__FIX__: ([#10650](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10841)) __'Deduplicate resource data blobs in the ARCD archive.'__ by AGulev
Fixes issue where two identical resources would be written into the `arcd` archive because they have different paths in the project.  
From now on, only one data blob will be written into the archive, and all duplicates will reference this single data blob from the manifest (and `arci`) file.

All the duplicates are still shown in the build report but with a size of 0.  
Also, the compressed size in the build report now includes alignment paddings for each file, which makes the `arcd` archive size equal to the total bytes shown in the report.

__FIX__: ([#10846](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10848)) __'Update GLFW gamepad functions for the latest version of Emscripten'__ by aglitchman
The gamepad code has been updated in GLFW for web for the latest version of Emscripten.

__FIX__: ([#10735](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10803)) __'Improved gamepad detection on engine startup'__ by britzl
The engine may crash on startup on windows (possibly also Linux) when detecting connected gamepads.

__FIX__: ([#10788](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10788)) __'Moved GetCollectionByHash() to dmsdk.'__ by Gert-Jan
Moved GetCollectionByHash() to dmsdk to allow for URLs to be turned into HCollection/HInstance/HComponent.

__FIX__: ([#10800](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10800)) __'Moved PropertyContainerCreateFromLua() to dmsdk'__ by Gert-Jan
Added `dmScript:: PropertyContainerCreateFromLua()` to `dmsdk/gameobject/script.h`

__FIX__: ([#10223](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10860)) __'Fix crash in HTML5 build when using HTTP request with the progress flag ON'__ by AGulev
Fixed a crash that happened only in the HTML5 build when an HTTP request was used with `{ report_progress = true }`.

__FIX__: ([#10870](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10871)) __'Fix example for resource.create_atlas()'__ by HalfstarDev


__FIX__: ([#10856](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10877)) __'Improved gamepad connect handling'__ by britzl
If the engine fails to get the name of a connected gamepad a default name will be used to avoid a crash on Windows.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8304,#8304](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10768)) __'Introduce code view context menu'__ by sprocketc
![Screenshot From 2025-06-02 18-49-18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f489cf-698c-4485-bb8f-887a0afc45ab)

__NEW__: ([#10708](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10777)) __'Adjusted default max time step of the engine to 1/30 of a second'__ by britzl
The default value for max time step was set to 0.5 seconds. Under normal use the engine will have a much lower time step and very rarely exceed 0.5 seconds, but when the game returns from an iconified state it is almost guaranteed to happen. The problem when this happens is that a value of 0.5 will be much too high and have a negative impact on physics simulations and other calculations where a lower time step is expected. This change sets the default value to 0.03333 seconds (ie 30 frames per second).

__FIX__: ([#10832](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10851)) __'Display tile attributes error on scene'__ by sprocketc
Display tile attributes error on the scene view, instead of throwing an exception.

__FIX__: ([#10829](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10839)) __'Fixed issue where `drag handle` interrupted the Tab key from moving to the next field'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#10670](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10759)) __'Fix issue where rebuilding the game from the Editor doesn't keep the simulated resolution'__ by AGulev
If the window resolution has been set in the Editor, it will be applied again when the engine is restarted from the Editor using Build To Target.

__FIX__: ([#10770,#8815,#10595](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10780)) __'Fix StackOverflow issue when pasting a too long string in the Editor'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#10790](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10790)) __'Edit GUI particlefx resources using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now it's possible to edit particlefx resources in the GUI using editor scripts, e.g.:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "particlefxs", {
        particlefx = "/confetti.particlefx"
    })
})
```

__FIX__: ([#10733](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10733)) __'Edit collision shapes using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
It is now possible to edit collision shapes using editor scripts! To support this, we added new `"shapes"` node list property to collision objects. For example, adding a new shape is done like this:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/hero.collisionobject", "shapes", {
        type = "shape-type-box" -- or "shape-type-sphere", "shape-type-capsule"
    })
})
```

To create a new collision shape, it is necessary to specify the type of the shape. The available types are:
- `shape-type-box` - box shape with `dimensions` property
- `shape-type-sphere` - sphere shape with `diameter` property
- `shape-type-capsule` - capsule shape with `diameter` and `height` properties

__FIX__: ([#10774](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10774)) __'Edit GUI layers using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now it's possible to edit GUI layers using editor scripts, e.g.:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "layers", {name = "foreground"}),
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "layers", {name = "background"})
})
```
Additionally, it's possible to reorder layers:
```lua
local fg, bg = table.unpack(editor.get("/main.gui", "layers"))
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.reorder("/main.gui", "layers", {bg, fg})
})
```

__FIX__: ([#10810](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10810)) __'Edit GUI layouts using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now you can edit a list of GUI layouts using editor scripts, e.g.:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", layouts, {name = "Landscape"}),
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", layouts, {name = "Portrait"})
})
```

__FIX__: ([#10801](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10801)) __'Edit GUI fonts using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
You can now edit GUI fonts using editor scripts, e.g.:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "fonts", {
        name = "font",
        font = "/main.font"
    })
})
```

__FIX__: ([#10822](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10824)) __'Add collections and game objects to root on drop'__ by sprocketc


__FIX__: ([#10858](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10858)) __'Edit GUI nodes using editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now you can edit GUI nodes using editor scripts, e.g.:
```lua
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "nodes", {
        type = "gui-node-type-box",
        position = {20, 20, 20}
    }),
    editor.tx.add("/main.gui", "nodes", {
        type = "gui-node-type-template",
        template = "/button.gui"
    }),
})
```

If the GUI file defines layouts, you can get and set the values from layouts using `layout:property` syntax, e.g.:
```lua
local node = editor.get("/main.gui", "nodes")[1]

-- GET:
local position = editor.get(node, "position")
pprint(position) -- {20, 20, 20}
local landscape_position = editor.get(node, "Landscape:position")
pprint(landscape_position) -- {20, 20, 20}

-- SET:
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.set(node, "Landscape:position", {30, 30, 30})
})
pprint(editor.get(node, "Landscape:position")) -- {30, 30, 30}
```

Layout properties that were set can be reset to their default values using `editor.tx.reset`:
```lua
print(editor.can_reset(node, "Landscape:position")) -- true
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.reset(node, "Landscape:position")
})
```
Template nodes can be read, but not edited: you can only set the properties of the template node tree:
```lua
local template = editor.get("/main.gui", "nodes")[2]
print(editor.can_add(template, "nodes")) -- false
local node_in_template = editor.get(template, "nodes")[1]
editor.transact({
    editor.tx.set(node_in_template, "text", "Button text")
})
print(editor.can_reset(node_in_template, "text")) -- true (overrides a value in the template)
```
