            "body": "Now, it's possible to edit (add/remove) atlas images and animations using editor scripts. This is achieved using the following additions to the editor script API:\r\n- atlas resources now define `images` and `animations` properties, which are lists of image and animation nodes, respectively\r\n- atlas animations now define an `images` property, which is a list of image nodes\r\n- `editor.get` can be used to get the list of images and animations in an atlas, and then to look up the properties of the returned nodes\r\n- new transaction functions `editor.tx.add`, `editor.tx.remove`, and `editor.tx.clear` can be used to edit these node lists\r\n- `editor.can_add` can be used to check if a node property is a list of nodes\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n1. Add an image to an atlas:\r\n   ```lua\r\n   editor.transact({\r\n       editor.tx.add(\"/main.atlas\", \"images\", {image=\"/assets/hero.png\"})\r\n   })\r\n   ```\r\n2. Find a set of all images used in an atlas:\r\n   ```lua\r\n   local all_images = {} ---@type table<string, true>\r\n   -- first, collect all \"bare\" images\r\n   local image_nodes = editor.get(\"/main.atlas\", \"images\")\r\n   for i = 1, #image_nodes do\r\n       all_images[editor.get(image_nodes[i], \"image\")] = true\r\n   end\r\n   -- second, collect all images used in animations\r\n   local animation_nodes = editor.get(\"/main.atlas\", \"animations\")\r\n   for i = 1, #animation_nodes do\r\n       local animation_image_nodes = editor.get(animation_nodes[i], \"images\")\r\n       for j = 1, #animation_image_nodes do\r\n           all_images[editor.get(animation_image_nodes[j], \"image\")] = true\r\n       end\r\n   end\r\n   pprint(all_images)\r\n   -- {\r\n   --     [\"/assets/hero.png\"] = true,\r\n   --     [\"/assets/enemy.png\"] = true,\r\n   -- }}\r\n   ```\r\n3. Replace all animations in an atlas:\r\n   ```lua\r\n   editor.transact({\r\n       editor.tx.clear(\"/main.atlas\", \"animations\"),\r\n       editor.tx.add(\"/main.atlas\", \"animations\", {\r\n           id = \"hero_run\",\r\n           images = {\r\n               {image = \"/assets/hero_run_1.png\"},\r\n               {image = \"/assets/hero_run_2.png\"},\r\n               {image = \"/assets/hero_run_3.png\"},\r\n               {image = \"/assets/hero_run_4.png\"}\r\n           }\r\n       })\r\n   })\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8504",

We added:\r\n- `\"emitters\"` and `\"modifiers\"` properties on particlefx component\r\n- `\"modifiers\"` property on particlefx emitter component\r\n- ability to read and write particlefx curve properties in editor scripts\r\n\r\nNew `emitters` and `modifiers` properties are node lists, where each node may be accessed using `editor.get()` and modified using `editor.tx.set()`. For example, adding a new circle emitter works like this:\r\n```lua\r\neditor.transact({\r\n    editor.tx.add(\"/fire.particlefx\", \"emitters\", {\r\n        type = \"emitter-type-circle\"\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurves are represented as a table with a non-empty list of `points`, where each point is a table with the following properties:\r\n- `x` - the x coordinate of the point, should start at 0 and end at 1\r\n- `y` - the value of the point\r\n- `tx` (0 to 1) and `ty` (-1 to 1) - tangents of the point. E.g., for an 80-degree angle, `tx` should be `math.cos(math.rad(80))` and `ty` should be `math.sin(math.rad(80))`.\r\nCurve spreads additionally have a `spread` number property.\r\n\r\nFor example, setting a particle lifetime alpha curve might look like this:\r\n```lua\r\neditor.transact({\r\n    editor.tx.set(emitter, \"particle_key_alpha\", { points = {\r\n        {x = 0,   y = 0, tx = 0.1, ty = 1}, -- start at 0, go up quickly\r\n        {x = 0.2, y = 1, tx = 1,   ty = 0}, -- reach 1 at 20% of a lifetime\r\n        {x = 1,   y = 0, tx = 1,   ty = 0}  -- slowly go down to 0\r\n    }})\r\n})\r\n```",
