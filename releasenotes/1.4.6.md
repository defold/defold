## Engine
__NEW__: ([#7544](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7544)) __Bundle only specified architectures in HTML5 builds__ 
HTML5 bundles always included both asm.js and wasm binaries, even if the `--architectures` option specified only one architecture. This change makes sure to only include the specified architecture, and in the case when wasm is not included the engine loader will not attempt to load or stream it.

__NEW__: ([#7521](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7521)) __Generate a build report for live update content__ 
The generated build reports will now also list excluded live update content in a separate report file.

```sh
java -jar bob.jar --verbose --platform=x86_64-macos --archive --liveupdate=yes --build-report=report.json --build-report-html=report.html clean build bundle
```

Will generate:

```
excluded_report.html
excluded_report.json
report.html
report.json
report_time.json
```

__NEW__: ([#7238](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7238)) __Set texture float support__ 
Exposed floating point texture formats to the resource script API:

```
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGB16F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGB32F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA16F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA32F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_R16F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RG16F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_R32F
resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RG32F
```
Note that the device running your game might not support all of these features, and the constants will only be exposed if it does. To check if the device can support a certain format, you can check if it is nil:

```
if resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA16F ~= nil then
    -- it is safe to use this format
end
```

__NEW__: ([#7559](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7559)) __Refactor textures as handles__ 
Refactored how textures and rendertargets are exposed and used in the engine, instead of passing around raw pointers, we now represent them as generic asset handles. This is the first step to bring the render and gameobject world closer together, where graphical assets can be transparently shared between them. Meaning, a texture that has been created by a script (or any texture, e.g an atlas texture) can be passed to the render scripts where it could be bound to the render state for drawing. Similarly, a render target could be created in a render script, passed to a game object and used as a texture on a model or an atlas.

__NEW__: ([#7578](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7578)) __Resource get texture info__ 
Added the new function `resource.get_texture_info` to get metadata from a texture resource or handle:

```
local my_texture_info = resource.get_texture_info(my_texture_path)

-- my_texture_info is a table that contains
{
     handle, -- the numeric handle of the texture
     width, -- width of the texture
     height, -- height of the texture
     depth, -- depth of the texture (1 for a 2D texture, 6 for a cube map and [1...slice-count] for an array texture)
     mipmaps, -- number of mipmaps the texture has
     type -- texture type
}
```

__NEW__: ([#7585](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7585)) __New paramenter `--max-cpu-threads` for `bob.jar`__ 
Added new parameter `--max-cpu-threads` for `bob.jar` which controls the maximum number of threads `bob.jar` can use. At the moment this value used only by the texture encoder.
Also, if texture compression is ON in the editor, the editor uses at least `detected_max_threads - 1` in case when 2–4 threads are available and `detected_max_threads - 2` if more than 4 cores are available.

__NEW__: ([#7583](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7583)) __Support texture handles in render.enable_texture__ 
Render scripts now support enabling texture handles via the `render.enable_texture` function. This means that you can pass a texture handle from scripts to the renderer and use them as global textures when rendering:

```
-- in a regular gameobject script:
local my_texture_info = resource.get_texture_info("/my_atlas.a.texturesetc")
msg.post("@render:", "set_my_texture", { handle = my_texture_info.handle })

-- in a render script:
function update(self, dt)
    render.enable_texture(0, self.my_texture)
end

function on_message(self, message_id, message)
    if message_id == hash("set_my_texture") then
        self.my_texture = message.handle
    end
end
```

__NEW__: ([#7591](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7591)) __Added back gesture support for Android 13__ 
Android 13 doesn't support Back button anymore. Instead, it uses back gesture. This 

>⚠️ `AndroidManifes.xml` updated with new flag `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` for the `<application>` tag. If you use your own manifest, make sure you apply the same changes.

__FIX__: ([#7477](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7477)) __Added option to make DefoldActivity transparent on Android__ 
It is now possible to make the main Activity transparency by adding a meta-data option in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
    <meta-data android:name="alpha.transparency" android:value="true" />
```

Note: By default the feature is disabled and does not negatively impact performance.

__FIX__: ([#7510](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7510)) __Crash when using a tilesource with 50 tiles__ 
**Describe the bug (REQUIRED)**
Crash when I try to load a tilesource as sprite of a game object. Works well with a tilesource having 30 tiles, but crashing with tilesource having 50 tiles.

**To Reproduce (REQUIRED)**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the project and build it to see it works (maximize the window to see the girl at the bottom left - sorry for black on black, as I removed the backgrounds layers)
2. Go back to the project
3. Go to `main.collection`, 
4. On `girl` go, replace the image with `/main/GirlRunningRight.tilesource` and the default animation with `GirlRunsRight`
5. Save and Build
6. See error

**Expected behavior (REQUIRED)**
```
Assertion failed: image->m_MipMapOffset.m_Count <= MAX_MIPMAP_COUNT, file ..\src\gamesys\resources\res_texture.cpp, line 129
INFO:CRASH: Successfully wrote Crashdump to file: C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Defold/_crash
```

__FIX__: ([#7565](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7565)) __CI: Disable pull_request_target trigger and remove 'skip-ci' commit message check__ 


__FIX__: ([#7603](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7603)) __Fix issue when setting up persistent file storage on HTML5 from a sandboxed iframe__ 
Setting up persistent file storage while running an HTML5 build from a sandboxed iframe on Firefox would throw an exception and stop the game from loading. This change will catch any exceptions thrown while setting up persistent file storage and continue to load the game.

__FIX__: ([#7607](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7607)) __Cubemap faces are flipped when bundling__ 
Fixed a bug where the cubemap +z and -z sides are uploaded incorrectly on OpenGL based graphics adapters.

__FIX__: ([#7373](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7373)) __Updated MoltenVK to v1.2.3 db8512a6__ 
We've updated the MoltenVK library to version 1.2.1

__FIX__: ([#7635](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7635)) __Fixed issue with finding the skin in an animated model__ 
This fixes a crash when the skin didn't have a name.

__FIX__: ([#7594](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7594)) __Added support for throwing a Java exception from the model compiler__ 
We've made the model compiler more robust and it will now catch any C/C++ errors, and then throw a Java error. This lets the editor handle such a case, and we minimise the risk of the user losing any edits in the project.

__FIX__: ([#7612](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7612)) __Fixed struct size calculation for buffer formats__ 
The allocated buffers used too much memory due to a miscalculation in the struct size.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7566](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7566)) __Show project template URLs on editor Welcome screen__ 
The project templates that are used on the editor Welcome screen are downloaded from GitHub when used. This change shows the URL of each template project in the list. The URL is clickable and will download the template project if selected. This will help users understand that the templates are not stored locally with the editor but downloaded from the internet, and thus require an internet connection to use.

__NEW__: ([#7614](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7614)) __Fix focus on committing values in the form view__ 


__FIX__: ([#7562](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7562)) __Clickable Lua preprocessor build errors__ 
* Build errors from `extension-lua-preprocessor` now show more information and are clickable in the Build Errors view.

__FIX__: ([#7570](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7570)) __Correct animation preview speed on high refresh rate screens__ 
The update speed for flipbook animations and particle effects were locked to 60 updates per second even if previewing on a high refresh rate screen (eg 144Hz).

__FIX__: ([#7551](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7551)) __Show output from the bundle process while bundling from the editor__ 
This fixes an issue in Defold 1.4.4 where output from the command line tool was not shown in the editor while bundling.

__FIX__: ([#7633](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7633)) __Fixed modelc exception handling for Win32__ 
We fixed a use-after-free issue that was noticed on Windows platforms.

__FIX__: ([#7576](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7576)) __Camera frustum preview__ 
Added a wireframe rendering of the camera frustum for the editor.
